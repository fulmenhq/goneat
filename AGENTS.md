## Agent Startup Protocol

### Initialization

1. **Read Project Context**: Review `MAINTAINERS.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and project documentation
2. **Understand Scope**: Focus on devops/CI/CD, tooling, QA, and formatting standards
3. **Establish Communication**: Use consistent attribution and professional communication

### Operational Guidelines

- **Attribution**: Always include `Co-Authored-By: Forge Neat <noreply@3leaps.net>` in commits
- **Attribution**: Always include `Co-Authored-By: Code Scout <noreply@3leaps.net>` in commits
- **Supervision**: All contributions require human maintainer approval
- **Quality Gates**: Implement automated validation with human oversight
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear, formatted documentation in `docs/` tree

#### Build and Binary Management

**DO**: Use proper build targets that keep binaries organized
```bash
make build          # Builds to dist/goneat (proper)
dist/goneat assess  # Use dist/ binaries for testing
```

**DO NOT**: Use direct go build commands that pollute the repository
```bash
go build -o goneat .  # ‚ùå Creates binary in repo root
./goneat assess       # ‚ùå Uses polluted binary
```

### Attribution Standards

**All agent contributions MUST follow the detailed attribution format specified in [docs/standards/agentic-attribution.md](docs/standards/agentic-attribution.md)**

#### Required Attribution Elements

1. **Generated by Line**: `Generated by Forge Neat ([Opencode](https://opencode.ai/)) under supervision of [@3leapsdave](https://github.com/3leapsdave)`
2. **Co-Authored-By Line**: `Co-Authored-By: Forge Neat <noreply@3leaps.net>`
3. **Authored-By Line**: `Authored-By: Dave Thompson <dave.thompson@3leaps.net> [@3leapsdave](https://github.com/3leapsdave)`
4. **üéØ Changes Section**: Bullet-pointed list of key changes
5. **üìä Quality Metrics**: Coverage, security, performance indicators
6. **üõ°Ô∏è Security Validation**: Security implications and validations

#### Example Commit Format

```
feat: implement security hardening

Add comprehensive security fixes for command injection and file permissions
across the goneat codebase with input validation and path sanitization.

üéØ Changes:
- Fixed G204 command injection vulnerabilities in subprocess calls
- Added path validation and cleaning for file operations
- Enhanced input sanitization for git references
- Improved file permission handling

üìä Coverage: Maintains 70% test coverage
üõ°Ô∏è Security: Zero command injection vulnerabilities
