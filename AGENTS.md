# Goneat - AI Agents Startup Guide

## . (Read First)

- If you have not discovered your agentic interface, pause and obtain clarification from a human maintainer before proceeding. After confirmation, read the corresponding interface adapter file.
- Do not assume an agentic identity (e.g., Code Scout, Forge Neat, Arch Eagle). If identity is not explicitly defined in your session, request assignment per `MAINTAINERS.md` before performing changes or commits.

## Agent Startup Protocol

### Initialization

1. **Read Project Context**: Review `MAINTAINERS.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and project documentation
2. **Complete Session Initialization Protocol**: Follow [docs/ops/templates/session-initialization-protocol.md](docs/ops/templates/session-initialization-protocol.md) for every work session
3. **Understand Scope**: Focus on devops/CI/CD, tooling, QA, and formatting standards
4. **Establish Communication**: Use consistent attribution and professional communication

### Operational Guidelines

- **Session Initialization Protocol**: üö® MANDATORY for every work session - [docs/ops/templates/session-initialization-protocol.md](docs/ops/templates/session-initialization-protocol.md)
- **Attribution**: Include `Co-Authored-By` only for material contributors, per [docs/standards/agentic-attribution.md](docs/standards/agentic-attribution.md).
- **Agent Emails**: Use `noreply@3leaps.net` for 3leaps agents (e.g., `Co-Authored-By: Code Scout <noreply@3leaps.net>`).
- **Supervision**: All contributions require human maintainer approval
- **Push Authorization**: üö® NEVER push without explicit per-incident human approval
- **Quality Gates**: Implement automated validation with human oversight
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear, formatted documentation in `docs/` tree
- **Referenced Docs**: Always read all referenced documentation before work

#### Build and Binary Management

**DO**: Use proper build targets that keep binaries organized

```bash
make build          # Builds to dist/goneat (proper) - includes required embeds
dist/goneat assess  # Use dist/ binaries for testing
```

**DO NOT**: Use direct go build commands that pollute the repository

```bash
go build -o goneat .  # ‚ùå Creates binary in repo root - MISSING EMBEDS
./goneat assess       # ‚ùå Uses polluted binary without embeds
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: Always use `make build` instead of `go build` - the Makefile includes embed generation that is required for the application to function properly. Direct `go build` commands will create incomplete binaries.

#### Planning and Documentation

**DO**: Use `.plans/` directory for planning documents (gitignored)

```bash
# Planning documents are local-only and not committed
.plans/active/v0.2.2/test-polish-plan.md  # ‚úÖ Local planning
.plans/archive/completed/                 # ‚úÖ Local archive
```

**DO NOT**: Commit planning files to git

```bash
git add .plans/         # ‚ùå Plans are gitignored
git commit .plans/      # ‚ùå Should remain local
```

#### Development Operations

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: Always use `make` targets for development operations. Never manually edit version files or run raw Go commands unless specifically debugging goneat itself.

##### Version Management

**DO**: Use make targets for all version operations

```bash
make version-set VERSION=v0.2.5    # ‚úÖ Set version properly with embeds
make version-bump-patch           # ‚úÖ Bump patch version
make version-bump-minor           # ‚úÖ Bump minor version
make version-bump-major           # ‚úÖ Bump major version
```

**DO NOT**: Manually edit VERSION file or use raw commands

```bash
echo "v0.2.5" > VERSION              # ‚ùå Manual edit - breaks embeds
go run ./cmd/version version-set   # ‚ùå Raw command - missing context
```

##### Build Operations

**DO**: Use make targets that include required embeds

```bash
make build          # ‚úÖ Builds to dist/ with embeds
make build-all      # ‚úÖ Cross-platform builds
make install        # ‚úÖ Install with proper versioning
```

**DO NOT**: Use raw go build commands

```bash
go build .                          # ‚ùå Missing embeds
go build -o goneat .               # ‚ùå Creates binary in wrong location
go install ./cmd/goneat            # ‚ùå Missing version context
```

##### Code Formatting

**DO**: Use make targets for consistent formatting

```bash
make fmt            # ‚úÖ Format all Go code
make format         # ‚úÖ Full format (Go + docs)
./dist/goneat format # ‚úÖ Use built binary for formatting
```

**DO NOT**: Use raw go fmt or other formatters

```bash
go fmt ./...                        # ‚ùå Inconsistent with project standards
gofmt -w .                          # ‚ùå Missing project-specific rules
prettier --write .                  # ‚ùå Use goneat format instead
```

##### Go Code Quality Standards

**DO**: Follow STDOUT hygiene and logging standards (see [docs/standards/go-coding-standards.md](docs/standards/go-coding-standards.md))

```go
logger.Debug("repo-status: detected files")   # ‚úÖ Use logger for debug output
logger.Info("Assessment completed")           # ‚úÖ Use logger for informational output
logger.Error("Failed to process")            # ‚úÖ Use logger for error output
```

**DO NOT**: Pollute STDOUT with debug or log output

```go
fmt.Printf("DEBUG: Creating issue\n")        # ‚ùå Pollutes STDOUT (breaks JSON output)
fmt.Println("Processing files...")           # ‚ùå Pollutes STDOUT (breaks structured output)
log.Printf("Status: %v", status)             # ‚ùå Use logger.Info instead
```

**Critical**: STDOUT must remain clean for JSON output and CLI tools that consume goneat's structured output. All debug, informational, and error messages must use the logger package to maintain output integrity.

##### Testing and Quality Gates

**DO**: Use make targets for comprehensive testing

```bash
make test           # ‚úÖ Run all tests
make pre-push       # ‚úÖ Full pre-push validation
make license-audit  # ‚úÖ License compliance check
```

**DO NOT**: Run individual commands without context

```bash
go test ./...                       # ‚ùå Missing build context
golangci-lint run                  # ‚ùå Use make pre-push instead
go-licenses csv .                   # ‚ùå Use make license-audit
```

##### Documentation and Assets

**DO**: Use make targets that handle embedding

```bash
make embed-assets   # ‚úÖ Embed docs and schemas
make verify-embeds  # ‚úÖ Verify embeds are correct
```

**DO NOT**: Manually manage embedded assets

```bash
# ‚ùå Don't manually copy files to internal/assets/
# ‚ùå Don't edit embedded content directly
# ‚ùå Don't commit without verifying embeds
```

### Git Operation Safety

**üö® CRITICAL: PUSH AUTHORIZATION REQUIREMENT**

**MANDATORY RULE**: AI agents are NEVER authorized to push code to remote repositories without explicit, per-incident human maintainer approval. This includes:

- Feature branches
- Main/master branches
- Release branches
- Any remote push operation

**DO**

```bash
git add <files>       # stage only
git commit -m "..."   # commit only
git push              # ‚ùå NEVER WITHOUT EXPLICIT APPROVAL
```

**DO NOT**

```bash
# Never chain critical ops
git add . && git commit -m "..." && git push
git commit && git push
# ‚ùå Never push without explicit human approval
```

**Push Process**:

1. Complete all work and commits locally
2. Request explicit push approval from human maintainer
3. Document approval in commit/PR description
4. Only then execute push with `--force-with-lease` if needed

See [repository-safety-protocols.md](repository-safety-protocols.md) for full rules.

### **üö® CRITICAL OPERATIONS CHECKLIST**

**MANDATORY**: Before ANY repository operation, complete this checklist:

#### **Pre-Operation Safety Check**
- [ ] **Operation Type**: Is this local-only or remote-affecting?
- [ ] **Safety Classification**: Level 1 (CATASTROPHIC), 2 (HIGH RISK), or 3 (MEDIUM RISK)?
- [ ] **Explicit Approval**: Do I have per-incident human maintainer approval?
- [ ] **Backup Created**: Is there a safety backup branch?
- [ ] **Repository Clean**: `git status` shows clean working tree?

#### **Level 1 CATASTROPHIC Operations** (NEVER without approval)
- [ ] History rewriting (`git reset --soft`, `git rebase`)
- [ ] Tag creation/deletion
- [ ] Remote push operations
- [ ] Force operations (`--force-with-lease`)
- [ ] Repository consolidation operations

#### **Level 2 HIGH RISK Operations** (Validate before execution)
- [ ] Bulk file operations
- [ ] Dependency modifications
- [ ] Configuration changes affecting CI/CD
- [ ] Large refactoring operations

#### **Level 3 MEDIUM RISK Operations** (Proceed with caution)
- [ ] Single file edits
- [ ] Documentation updates
- [ ] Test additions
- [ ] Code formatting operations

**‚ùå STOP**: If ANY checklist item is unanswered or marked "NO", request explicit human maintainer approval before proceeding.

### Attribution Standards

**All agent contributions MUST follow the detailed attribution format specified in [docs/standards/agentic-attribution.md](docs/standards/agentic-attribution.md)**

#### Required Attribution Elements

1. **Generated by Line**: `Generated by Forge Neat ([Opencode](https://opencode.ai/)) under supervision of [@3leapsdave](https://github.com/3leapsdave)`
2. **Co-Authored-By Line**: `Co-Authored-By: Forge Neat <noreply@3leaps.net>`
3. **Authored-By Line**: `Authored-By: Dave Thompson <dave.thompson@3leaps.net> [@3leapsdave](https://github.com/3leapsdave)`
4. **üéØ Changes Section**: Bullet-pointed list of key changes
5. **üìä Quality Metrics**: Coverage, security, performance indicators
6. **üõ°Ô∏è Security Validation**: Security implications and validations
