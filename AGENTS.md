# Goneat - AI Agents Startup Guide

## . (Read First)

- If you have not discovered your agentic interface, pause and obtain clarification from a human maintainer before proceeding. After confirmation, read the corresponding interface adapter file.
- Do not assume an agentic identity (e.g., Code Scout, Forge Neat, Arch Eagle). If identity is not explicitly defined in your session, request assignment per `MAINTAINERS.md` before performing changes or commits.

## Agent Startup Protocol

### Initialization

1. **Read Project Context**: Review `MAINTAINERS.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and project documentation
2. **Understand Scope**: Focus on devops/CI/CD, tooling, QA, and formatting standards
3. **Establish Communication**: Use consistent attribution and professional communication

### Operational Guidelines

- **Attribution**: Include `Co-Authored-By` only for material contributors, per [docs/standards/agentic-attribution.md](docs/standards/agentic-attribution.md).
- **Agent Emails**: Use `noreply@3leaps.net` for 3leaps agents (e.g., `Co-Authored-By: Code Scout <noreply@3leaps.net>`).
- **Supervision**: All contributions require human maintainer approval
- **Quality Gates**: Implement automated validation with human oversight
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear, formatted documentation in `docs/` tree

#### Build and Binary Management

**DO**: Use proper build targets that keep binaries organized

```bash
make build          # Builds to dist/goneat (proper) - includes required embeds
dist/goneat assess  # Use dist/ binaries for testing
```

**DO NOT**: Use direct go build commands that pollute the repository

```bash
go build -o goneat .  # ‚ùå Creates binary in repo root - MISSING EMBEDS
./goneat assess       # ‚ùå Uses polluted binary without embeds
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: Always use `make build` instead of `go build` - the Makefile includes embed generation that is required for the application to function properly. Direct `go build` commands will create incomplete binaries.

#### Planning and Documentation

**DO**: Use `.plans/` directory for planning documents (gitignored)

```bash
# Planning documents are local-only and not committed
.plans/active/v0.2.2/test-polish-plan.md  # ‚úÖ Local planning
.plans/archive/completed/                 # ‚úÖ Local archive
```

**DO NOT**: Commit planning files to git

```bash
git add .plans/         # ‚ùå Plans are gitignored
git commit .plans/      # ‚ùå Should remain local
```

### Git Operation Safety

**DO**

```bash
git add <files>       # stage only
git commit -m "..."   # commit only
git push              # push only (with approval)
```

**DO NOT**

```bash
# Never chain critical ops
git add . && git commit -m "..." && git push
git commit && git push
```

See [REPOSITORY-SAFETY-PROTOCOLS.md](REPOSITORY-SAFETY-PROTOCOLS.md) for full rules.

### Attribution Standards

**All agent contributions MUST follow the detailed attribution format specified in [docs/standards/agentic-attribution.md](docs/standards/agentic-attribution.md)**

#### Required Attribution Elements

1. **Generated by Line**: `Generated by Forge Neat ([Opencode](https://opencode.ai/)) under supervision of [@3leapsdave](https://github.com/3leapsdave)`
2. **Co-Authored-By Line**: `Co-Authored-By: Forge Neat <noreply@3leaps.net>`
3. **Authored-By Line**: `Authored-By: Dave Thompson <dave.thompson@3leaps.net> [@3leapsdave](https://github.com/3leapsdave)`
4. **üéØ Changes Section**: Bullet-pointed list of key changes
5. **üìä Quality Metrics**: Coverage, security, performance indicators
6. **üõ°Ô∏è Security Validation**: Security implications and validations

#### Example Commit Format

```
