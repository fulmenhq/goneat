# Goneat v0.2.0-rc.1 — Schema Validation, Scoped Discovery, and Ignore Overrides (2025-09-05)

## TL;DR

- Schema validation (JSON/YAML): offline‑first structural checks for Draft‑07 and 2020‑12
- Scoped discovery: `--scope` + `--force-include` for precise runs on ignored paths
- Opt‑in meta validation: `--enable-meta` for full JSON Schema meta validation

## Highlights

- Schema Validation (offline‑first)
  - Structural sanity checks: `type`, `required`, `additionalProperties`
  - Cross‑platform path detection: recognizes any `schemas/` path segment
  - Avoids inadvertent network access by default

- Discovery & DX Controls
  - `--scope`: limit traversal to explicit `--include` directories and anchors from `--force-include`
  - `--force-include`: bring back ignored files/dirs; supports quoted globs (repeatable)
  - `--no-ignore`: bypass `.goneatignore`/`.gitignore` for the run
  - DX docs updated with quoted glob examples and clear guidance

- Meta‑Schema Validation (opt‑in)
  - `--enable-meta` (validate) / `--schema-enable-meta` (assess)
  - Uses embedded meta‑schemas; remote `$ref` may require network

## Performance

- Bad fixtures (2 files): ~260–280ms scoped
- Single file: ~200ms
- Repo schemas (5 files + meta): ~2–3s; 0 issues

## Upgrade Notes

- Default validation is offline‑first. Use `--enable-meta` for full meta validation.
- Quote globs to avoid shell expansion: `--force-include 'tests/fixtures/**'`
- Positional files (via `--include <file>`) always override ignores.

## Try It Now

- Validate ignored fixtures only:
  - `goneat validate --scope --include tests/fixtures/schemas/bad/ --force-include 'tests/fixtures/schemas/bad/**' --format concise`
- Validate repo schemas with meta:
  - `goneat validate --include schemas/ --enable-meta --format concise`

## v0.2.0-rc.7 (2025-09-07)

This RC consolidates process improvements:

- Build Gate: pre-push depends on build-all; binaries produced before validation.
- Packaging: dist/release contains platform archives + SHA256SUMS.
- License Audit: GH Action added to run make license-audit and upload inventory.
- Formatting: repo-wide Go formatting sweep (low-severity cleanup).
- Docs: install instructions and naming clarification.

Note: rc.2–rc.6 were in-progress artifacts to refine the release process; rc.7 is the consolidated candidate.
## v0.2.1

This release introduces a curated documentation workflow baked into the binary and expands our embedding SOP to cover docs, ensuring reliable offline access and CI drift protection.

### Highlights
- New `docs` command (read‑only): list/show embedded docs (JSON‑first output).
- New `content` command: manifest‑driven curation with `find`, `embed`, and `verify` for docs mirrors.
- JSON Schema for embed manifest (2020‑12) and initial curated manifest.

### Operational Improvements
- `embed-assets` prefers CLI for docs mirroring.
- `verify-embeds` now uses `goneat content verify` for precise drift checks.

### Security & Quality
- Safer defaults for security scanning (exclude fixtures by default).
- All content operations are rooted and read‑only in runtime commands.

### Roadmap
- v0.2.2: Frontmatter‑aware selection and metadata enrichment.

## v0.2.1-rc.1

Pre-GA candidate introducing curated docs embedding and the new docs/content commands. Served as the integration checkpoint before GA 0.2.1.

### Highlights
- `docs list|show`: read‑only access to embedded docs (JSON‑first)
- `content find|embed|verify`: manifest‑driven curation and mirror management
- CI integration: verify-embeds uses content verify for precise drift checks

### Notes
- This RC preceded 0.2.1 GA with the same feature set; minor polish landed in GA.
