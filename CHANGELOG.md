[0.2.2-rc.1]: https://github.com/fulmenhq/goneat/compare/v0.2.1...v0.2.2-rc.1

## [0.2.1] - 2025-09-08

### Added

- New `docs` command for read-only offline docs (list/show; JSON/markdown/html, `--open` to browser)
- New `content` command for curated docs management (`find`, `embed`, `verify`), with JSON report schema
- JSON Schema for docs embed manifest (`schemas/content/docs-embed-manifest-v1.0.0.json`)
- Tests for content/docs commands (JSON outputs and verify path)
- Security quick alias: `goneat security secrets` (gitleaks-only convenience)

### Changed

- Embedding SOP extended to include curated docs via content command
- `embed-assets` prefers CLI for docs mirroring; `verify-embeds` uses `goneat content verify`
- README and root help emphasize `docs` (viewing) vs `content` (curation)

### Fixed

- Removed footer attributions from embedded docs to keep output clean

[0.2.1]: https://github.com/fulmenhq/goneat/compare/v0.2.0...v0.2.1

## [0.2.1-rc.1] - 2025-09-08

### Added

- Introduced curated docs pipeline and commands ahead of GA
- Initial manifest and CI verification wiring for embedded docs

### Notes

- Superseded by 0.2.1 GA with minor polish

[0.2.1-rc.1]: https://github.com/fulmenhq/goneat/compare/v0.2.0...v0.2.1-rc.1

## [0.2.0] - 2025-09-07

### Added

- Schema validation (JSON/YAML) with offline-first checks (Draft-07, 2020-12)
- Discovery controls: `--scope`, `--force-include`, `--no-ignore`
- Opt-in meta-schema validation: `--enable-meta` / `--schema-enable-meta`

### Changed

- Scoped traversal and DX improvements with quoted glob guidance

### Performance

- Bad fixtures: ~260‚Äì280ms scoped; single file ~200ms; repo schemas ~2‚Äì3s

[0.2.0]: https://github.com/fulmenhq/goneat/releases/tag/v0.2.0

## [0.2.0-rc.1] - 2025-09-05

### Added

- Schema validation (JSON/YAML) with offline-first structural checks (Draft-07, 2020-12)
- New flags for discovery control:
  - `--scope` to limit traversal to include paths and force-include anchors
  - `--force-include` to bring back ignored files/dirs (repeatable; glob-friendly)
  - `--no-ignore` to bypass ignore files for a run
  - `--enable-meta` / `--schema-enable-meta` to perform meta-schema validation (opt-in)
- Non-schema JSON/YAML fixtures in both good and bad sets to ensure no false positives

### Changed

- Improved file discovery to avoid skipping ancestors of forced paths
- Scoped-dir discovery uses targeted traversal for predictable DX
- Documentation updated with quoting globs guidance and scoped examples

### Fixed

- Path detection for schema files (relative `schemas` segment)
- Eliminated previous slowdowns from remote meta-schema fetch during default validation

[0.2.0-rc.1]: https://github.com/fulmenhq/goneat/compare/v0.1.5...v0.2.0-rc.1

## [0.1.6] - In Development

### Added

- Comprehensive test coverage improvements for `pkg/work/format_processor`, `pkg/work/planner`, and `pkg/format/finalizer` packages
- New intuitive CLI flags for format command: `--files` and `--patterns` for clearer file selection

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Replaced confusing `-f/--files` flag behavior in format command
  - **Old**: `-f "*.go"` treated as glob pattern for file discovery
  - **New**: `--files file1 file2` for explicit file lists, `--patterns "*.go"` for glob filtering
  - **Migration**: Use `--patterns` for old `-f` pattern behavior, `--files` for specific files
  - **Validation**: Clear error messages prevent conflicting flag combinations

### Fixed

- Fixed os.RemoveAll error handling in test cleanup code (addressed high-severity lint issues)

## [0.1.5] - 2025-09-05

### Added

- üéâ Diff‚ÄëAware Assessment (Change‚ÄëSet Intelligence)

  - Go‚Äëgit‚Äìfirst collection with CLI fallback for unified diffs
- üîé Suppression Insights (Security)
  - `categories.security.suppression_report.summary` now includes `by_rule_files`, `by_file`, `top_rules`, `top_files`
  - New CLI flag `--track-suppressions` on `assess` to expose intentional suppressions
- üìö Documentation
  - Assess docs updated with change‚Äëaware assessment and suppression examples
  - README highlights diff‚Äëaware assessment and suppression insights
- üß™ Smart Semantic Validation (Preview)
  - Schema‚Äëaware validation category scaffolding (pending finalize for 0.1.5)
  - Config‚Äëfirst patterns and opt‚Äëin auto‚Äëdetect (planned)

### Changed

  - Category status values standardized to `success`, `error`, or `skipped`
- üß™ CLI test robustness
  - Fresh `assess` command instance per subtest to avoid flag reuse

### Fixed

- Reduced runner ‚Äúfailed without error‚Äù log noise to debug in hook mode context
- Concise output: fallback to first issue message when no file path is available

### Fixed

## [0.2.0-rc.7] - 2025-09-07

### Added
- GitHub Actions: License audit workflow (make license-audit) that uploads inventory artifact.

### Changed
- Pre-push now depends on build-all to ensure binaries are built before gate.
- Packaging script writes artifacts to dist/release and includes SHA256SUMS.
- Repo-wide low-severity formatting sweep (Go files).
- Docs: install instructions and naming clarification in README.

### Notes
- rc.2‚Äìrc.6 were in-progress RCs used to refine the process; rc.7 consolidates the changes into a stable candidate.
## v0.2.1 (Release Candidate)

### Added
- Content curation command: `goneat content` with `find`, `embed`, and `verify` subcommands for manifest‚Äëdriven docs selection and mirror management (JSON‚Äëfirst).
- Read‚Äëonly docs command: `goneat docs list|show` to access embedded curated documentation offline.
- JSON Schema (2020‚Äë12) for docs embed manifest: `schemas/content/docs-embed-manifest-v1.0.0.json`.

### Changed
- Embed/verify SOP extended to include curated docs. `scripts/embed-assets.sh` prefers CLI for docs; `scripts/verify-embeds.sh` now uses `goneat content verify`.
- Security defaults: add `security.exclude_fixtures` and `security.fixture_patterns` to avoid scanning fixtures by default.

### Notes
- Curated docs are selected via `docs/embed-manifest.yaml` and mirrored to `internal/assets/embedded_docs/docs/` to ensure `go install` includes assets.
- Frontmatter‚Äëbased selection planned for v0.2.2.

### Security
- All content operations are rooted under `docs/`; writes use 0644; no network access.
