# v0.1.x: Security Refinements (govulncheck, Exposure Filters, Suppressions)

- Owner: Code Scout (üîç)
- Status: Planned
- Scope: Deepen vulnerability scanning usability: module-level granularity, exposure-based filtering, suppression UX

## Objective
Reduce noise and make security findings actionable in large repos by focusing on exposed artifacts, allowing justified suppressions, and clarifying module-level context.

## Features
- govulncheck refinements: precise module/package mapping in issues; SARIF export
- Exposure filters: mark internal tools/services as non-exposed; de-prioritize or suppress
- Suppression UX: per-issue suppressions with rationales, TTL, and audit trail

## Config
```yaml
security:
  tools: ["gosec","govulncheck"]
  exposure:
    default: external
    rules:
      - pattern: "cmd/internal/**"
        exposure: internal
      - pattern: "tools/**"
        exposure: internal
  suppressions:
    file: ".goneat/security-suppressions.yaml"
    require_ttl: true
```

## CLI
- `--exposure-rules file.yml`, `--suppressions file.yml`, `--export sarif`

## Tests
- Unit: exposure rule matching, suppression TTL, SARIF mapping
- Integration: repo fixtures with mixed internal/external packages; noisy deps trimmed
