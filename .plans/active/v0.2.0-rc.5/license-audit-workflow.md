# Plan: GitHub Actions License Audit (RC.5)

**Release**: v0.2.0-rc.5
**Owner**: Forge Neat + Code Scout (supervised by @3leapsdave)
**Generated by**: Code Scout ([Opencode](https://opencode.ai/)) under supervision of [@3leapsdave](https://github.com/3leapsdave)

## Goal

Add a minimal GitHub Actions workflow to audit dependency licenses on PRs and main pushes, blocking forbidden licenses.

## Steps

1. Workflow `.github/workflows/license-audit.yml`
   - Trigger: pull_request, push to main
   - Setup Go + cache
   - Install `go-licenses`
   - Run `make license-audit`
   - Upload `dist/reports/license-inventory.csv` as artifact
2. Document in RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md that CI gate must be green for release.

## Notes

- Keeps RC cadence small and focused; no feature flags required.
- Complements 0.2.1 work that adds first-class `goneat license` CLI + assess category.
