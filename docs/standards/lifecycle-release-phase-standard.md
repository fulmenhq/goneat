# Lifecycle & Release Phase Standard

This standard defines the allowed values, purpose, and usage of the repository phase files used for quality gates and operational policy.

## Files (SSOT)

- `LIFECYCLE_PHASE`: product maturity phase
  - Allowed: `experimental`, `alpha`, `beta`, `rc`, `ga`, `lts`
  - Schema: `schemas/config/lifecycle-phase-v1.0.0.json`

- `RELEASE_PHASE`: distribution cadence phase
  - Allowed: `dev`, `rc`, `ga`
  - Schema: `schemas/config/release-phase-v1.0.0.json`
  - Optional file. When present, CI/Makefile should consider both values and use the stricter gate.

## Purpose

- Drive coverage thresholds and quality gates deterministically
- Provide machine-readable maturity and release signals without ambiguity
- Enable cross-repo operational consistency across FulmenHQ

## Policy Semantics

- Coverage thresholds (Makefile):
  - Lifecycle: experimental=0, alpha=30, beta=60, rc=70, ga=75, lts=80
  - Release: dev=50, rc=70, ga=75
  - If `RELEASE_PHASE` is present, the higher of the two thresholds applies.

- CI and release automation may consume these values to select pipelines or block promotions.

## Validation

- Integration tests validate that `LIFECYCLE_PHASE` and `RELEASE_PHASE` (if present) contain allowed values:
  - `tests/integration/phase_files_test.go`

## Change Control

- Proposed changes must update both the JSON Schemas and the integration test.
- Changes require approval by the project lead.
