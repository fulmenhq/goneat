# Lifecycle & Release Phase Standard

This standard defines the allowed values, purpose, and usage of the repository phase files used for quality gates and operational policy.

## Files (SSOT: Crucible Schemas)

Phase validation follows **crucible schemas** as the single source of truth. These schemas are synced from [fulmenhq/crucible](https://github.com/fulmenhq/crucible) and embedded in goneat.

- `LIFECYCLE_PHASE`: product maturity phase (repo-level, shared across FulmenHQ tools)
  - Allowed: `experimental`, `alpha`, `beta`, `rc`, `ga`, `lts`
  - Schema: `schemas/crucible-go/config/repository/v1.0.0/lifecycle-phase.json`

- `RELEASE_PHASE`: distribution cadence phase (goneat-specific deployment gates)
  - Allowed: `dev`, `rc`, `ga`, `release`
  - Schema: `schemas/crucible-go/config/goneat/v1.0.0/release-phase.json`
  - Note: `release` is equivalent to `ga`
  - Optional file. When present, CI/Makefile should consider both values and use the stricter gate.

## Purpose

- Drive coverage thresholds and quality gates deterministically
- Provide machine-readable maturity and release signals without ambiguity
- Enable cross-repo operational consistency across FulmenHQ

## Policy Semantics

- Coverage thresholds (Makefile):
  - Lifecycle: experimental=0, alpha=30, beta=60, rc=70, ga=75, lts=80
  - Release: dev=50, rc=70, ga=75
  - If `RELEASE_PHASE` is present, the higher of the two thresholds applies.

- CI and release automation may consume these values to select pipelines or block promotions.

## Validation

- Integration tests validate that `LIFECYCLE_PHASE` and `RELEASE_PHASE` (if present) contain allowed values:
  - `tests/integration/phase_files_test.go`
- Code validation uses `internal/maturity/phases.go` which derives valid values from crucible schemas

## Change Control

- **SSOT**: Crucible schemas define allowed values; goneat follows
- Proposed changes to allowed values must be made in crucible first
- After crucible update, goneat picks up changes on next sync/rebuild
- Local changes require approval by the project lead
