# Fulmen Binary Distribution Standard

This standard defines how Fulmen ecosystem CLIs are packaged and distributed across platforms and package managers. It ensures consistent naming, verification, and installation workflows for end users and CI systems.

## Goals

- Consistent artifact naming and checksums/signatures
- Reproducible builds with clear provenance
- First-class install paths: Homebrew (macOS/Linux), Scoop (Windows), AUR/Pacman (Arch), direct install scripts (curl/PowerShell)
- Automated releases and update propagation

## Supported channels

- Homebrew: official tap (`3leaps/tap`) with per-project formulae
- Scoop: bucket repository (`3leaps/scoop-bucket`) manifests
- Arch Linux: AUR `-bin` packages (preferred) backed by GitHub Releases
- Direct installers: `install.sh` (curl | bash) and `install.ps1` (PowerShell)
- GitHub Releases: canonical source of signed artifacts

## Artifact layout and naming

- Naming: `{project}_{version}_{os}_{arch}.{ext}`
  - Example: `goneat_0.1.4_darwin_arm64.tar.gz`, `goneat_0.1.4_windows_amd64.zip`
- Archive contents:
  - Binary: `goneat` (or `goneat.exe` on Windows)
  - LICENSE, README snippet (optional)
- Checksums: `SHA256SUMS` at release root covering all artifacts
- Signatures: `SHA256SUMS.sig` (GPG) or `SHA256SUMS.txt.sig` (equivalent)

## Verification requirements

- Publish SHA-256 checksums and detached signature in every release
- Installer scripts verify checksum (and signature if GPG available)
- Packaging toolchains (brew, scoop, AUR) reference checksums

## Release process (standard)

1. Preflight
   - Ensure lifecycle gates pass (coverage, security scans)
   - Tag: `vX.Y.Z`
2. Build
   - Cross-compile for linux/windows/darwin and common arches (amd64, arm64)
   - Produce archives and `SHA256SUMS`
3. Sign
   - Sign `SHA256SUMS` with Fulmen release key (GPG)
4. Publish
   - Create GitHub Release for tag; upload artifacts, checksums, signature
   - Include release notes and lifecycle status snippet
5. Package managers
   - Homebrew: update formula in `3leaps/tap`
   - Scoop: update manifest in `3leaps/scoop-bucket`
   - AUR: update `goneat-bin` with new version and checksums
6. Announce
   - Update docs; post in appropriate channels

## Homebrew (tap) standard

- Tap: `3leaps/tap`
- Formula naming: `goneat.rb`
- Formula pulls tarball from GitHub Release and validates SHA256
- Bottles optional initially; fallback to tarballs
- Update flow: bump version and checksum via automation

## Scoop (bucket) standard

- Bucket: `3leaps/scoop-bucket`
- Manifest: `goneat.json`
- Keys: `version`, `architecture` (urls + sha256), `bin`, `checkver`, `autoupdate`
- Update flow: automation updates `version` and `autoupdate` URLs/checksums

## Arch Linux (AUR) standard

- Package: `goneat-bin`
- PKGBUILD downloads prebuilt tarball, verifies sha256, installs to `/usr/bin`
- Maintain `.SRCINFO` and keep metadata minimal

## Direct install scripts

- `scripts/install.sh` (POSIX shell)
  - Detect OS/arch, find matching asset, verify SHA256, install to `/usr/local/bin` (fallback `~/.local/bin`)
- `scripts/install.ps1` (PowerShell)
  - Detect OS/arch, download asset, verify SHA256, install to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs` and add to PATH (if needed)

## Automation

- Prefer `goreleaser` for reproducible builds and artifact matrix
- Fallback: project `Makefile` + `scripts/build-all.sh` + `scripts/checksums.sh`
- CI: GitHub Actions release workflow triggered on tag `v*`

## Security and provenance

- Use dedicated Fulmen GPG release key; publish fingerprint in `oss-policies`
- Verify signatures in installer scripts when GPG present; else require checksum
- Keep supply chain SBOMs optional initially; plan to add later (trivy/syft)

## Versioning

- SemVer required for CLI distributions (`vX.Y.Z` tags)
- Pre-releases allowed (`-alpha.N`, `-beta.N`, `-rc.N`) with channels reflected in docs

## Documentation

- Each project MUST include:
  - `docs/user-guide/install.md` with channel-specific instructions
  - Release SOP under `docs/ops/` referencing this standard
