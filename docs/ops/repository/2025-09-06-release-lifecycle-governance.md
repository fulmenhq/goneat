# Release & Lifecycle Governance

This document defines how Goneat uses `LIFECYCLE_PHASE` and `RELEASE_PHASE` to drive CI coverage gates, publishing behaviors, and operational policy.

## Phase Sources

- `LIFECYCLE_PHASE`: maturity (experimental | alpha | beta | rc | ga | lts)
- `RELEASE_PHASE`: cadence (dev | rc | ga)

Schemas: see `schemas/config/*-phase-v1.0.0.json`.

## Policy Application

- Coverage gates (Makefile target `coverage-check`):
  - Determine lifecycle and release thresholds
  - If `RELEASE_PHASE` exists, use the stricter (max) threshold
  - Fail the build if coverage is below threshold

- Publishing:
  - `rc` cadence: publish to prerelease channels (GitHub releases with `-rc.N`, optional taps)
  - `ga` cadence: publish stable channels (Homebrew/Scoop/AUR) after verification

## Operational Notes

- Values are single tokens per file, case-insensitive.
- Tests enforce allowed values to prevent typos.
- Phase changes should be reviewed by the project lead.
