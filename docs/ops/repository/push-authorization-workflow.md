# Push Authorization Workflow

**MANDATORY**: All push operations require explicit human maintainer approval.

## Workflow Overview

```
Agent Work ‚Üí Pre-Push Validation ‚Üí Approval Request ‚Üí Human Review ‚Üí Authorized Push
```

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Agent Pre-Push Validation

**Agent Responsibility**: Complete all validations before requesting approval.

```bash
# Quality Gates (MANDATORY)
make pre-commit          # All quality checks pass
make pre-push           # Additional validation
make test-coverage-check # Coverage requirements met

# Content Validation
git --no-pager log --oneline -5  # Review recent commits
# Verify attribution standards followed
# Check for sensitive data
```

### Step 2: Approval Request

**Agent Responsibility**: Submit formal approval request.

**Request Format**:

```
üö® PUSH APPROVAL REQUEST

Agent: [Forge Neat]
Branch: [feature-branch]
Target: [origin/main]
Changes: [Brief summary of what will be pushed]

Pre-Push Validation Complete:
‚úÖ make pre-commit passed
‚úÖ make pre-push passed
‚úÖ Coverage requirements met
‚úÖ Attribution standards followed
‚úÖ No sensitive data detected

Requesting approval from @3leapsdave to execute push.
```

### Step 3: Human Review

**Supervisor Responsibility**: Review and approve/reject request.

**Review Checklist**:

- [ ] Changes align with approved work scope
- [ ] Quality gates actually passed (verify if needed)
- [ ] No unauthorized commits or changes
- [ ] Attribution and documentation correct
- [ ] Push serves legitimate development purpose

**Approval Format**:

```
‚úÖ PUSH APPROVED

Approved by: @3leapsdave
Date: 2025-09-19 07:45
Rationale: [Brief approval reason]
Conditions: [Any special conditions, e.g., "Use --force-with-lease"]
```

**Rejection Format**:

```
‚ùå PUSH DENIED

Reason: [Specific reason for denial]
Required Actions: [What agent must do before re-requesting]
```

### Step 4: Authorized Push

**Agent Responsibility**: Execute push only after approval.

```bash
# Document approval in commit message
git commit --amend -m "feat: [description]

[Original message]

Push approved by @3leapsdave on [date]"

# Execute push
git push origin [branch]

# Document completion
# Update push checklist with results
```

## Emergency Procedures

### Level 1 Emergency (System Down)

- **Trigger**: Production system failure requiring immediate fix
- **Process**: Supervisor can grant blanket approval for emergency pushes
- **Documentation**: Must be logged in incident report

### Level 2 Emergency (Build Breaking)

- **Trigger**: CI/CD pipeline broken, blocking all development
- **Process**: Require supervisor approval but allow faster review
- **Documentation**: Must be justified in post-mortem

## Audit Trail

All push operations must maintain audit trail:

- Pre-push checklist completion
- Approval request documentation
- Supervisor approval record
- Push execution confirmation
- Post-push validation results

## Violation Consequences

- **First Violation**: Warning and mandatory retraining
- **Second Violation**: Temporary suspension of push privileges
- **Third Violation**: Permanent revocation of autonomous push capability

**MANDATORY**: This workflow ensures safety while enabling efficient development. All agents must follow it without exception.
