# Release Process

This is the standard release process for Goneat, aligned with FulmenHQ practices.

## Phases

- `LIFECYCLE_PHASE`: experimental | alpha | beta | rc | ga | lts (maturity)
- `RELEASE_PHASE`: dev | rc | ga (cadence)

See schemas under `schemas/config/*-phase-v1.0.0.json` and the standard in `docs/standards/lifecycle-release-phase-standard.md`.

## Steps

1) Set phases

```bash
echo rc > LIFECYCLE_PHASE
echo rc > RELEASE_PHASE
```

2) Set version (SemVer; use prerelease for RCs)

```bash
make version-set VERSION_SET=0.2.0-rc.1
```

3) Build + test + coverage (gates apply via phases)

```bash
make test-coverage && make coverage-check
```

4) Build artifacts

```bash
make build-all
```

5) Release notes artifact

```bash
make release-notes
# dist/release/release-notes-v<version>.md
```

6) Tag (annotated)

```bash
git tag -a v$(cat VERSION) -m "$(head -n 1 dist/release/release-notes-v$(cat VERSION).md)"
```

7) Push (manual approval step)

```bash
git push origin main
git push origin v$(cat VERSION)
```

8) Draft GitHub release

- Attach bin/* (or packaged artifacts)
- Paste contents of dist/release/release-notes-v<version>.md

## Notes

- RCs use `-rc.N` prereleases; GA re-tags without suffix when stable.
- Coverage gates use the stricter of Lifecycle/Release thresholds.
- Docs and standards updates should accompany notable changes.
