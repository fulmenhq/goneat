# Repository Org Migration Note: 3leaps → fulmenhq (RC.5)

**Date**: 2025-09-07
**Context**: Public flip preparation and release shakedown (v0.2.0 RC series)
**Generated by**: Code Scout ([Opencode](https://opencode.ai/)) under supervision of [@3leapsdave](https://github.com/3leapsdave)

## Summary

During the public flip, we discovered the Go module path still referenced the previous organization (`github.com/3leaps/goneat`). The repository has been under the `fulmenhq` org for some time, but the module path was not updated pre‑flip. We corrected this in v0.2.0‑rc.5.

## What Changed in RC.5

- Module path: `go.mod` updated to `module github.com/fulmenhq/goneat`.
- Internal imports: all `github.com/3leaps/goneat/...` -> `github.com/fulmenhq/goneat/...`.
- Documentation & links: README badges/links, MAINTAINERS, AGENTS, CHANGELOG, Makefile release links, and docs updated to `fulmenhq`.
- Packaging templates: Homebrew, Scoop, AUR templates now point to `fulmenhq/goneat` releases.
- Hook messages/docs: “go install” guidance updated to `github.com/fulmenhq/goneat@latest`.
- Licensing inventory: updated module reference in inventory CSV/MD.

## Impact

- pkg.go.dev indexing now aligns with the canonical path: `github.com/fulmenhq/goneat`.
- Downstream consumers should use `go install github.com/fulmenhq/goneat@<version>`.
- No API/behavioral change; internal package paths only.

## Oversight & Lesson Learned

- The module path remained under the old org during private development. This created friction for pkg.go.dev and installation instructions.
- Add a checklist item to our release SOP:
  - “Verify module path matches canonical repo org/slug before public flip.”

## Follow‑ups

- rc.5 planning adds a GitHub Actions license audit; next step is CI gates for builds.
- Optional: run a repo‑wide format pass to reduce low‑severity format noise post‑migration.
