# Repository Operation: Hooks Policy - Dates Category Integration

**Date**: 2025-09-11
**Context**: Quality assurance enhancement for v0.2.3 release preparation
**Generated by**: Forge Neat ([Cursor](https://cursor.sh/)) under supervision of [@3leapsdave](https://github.com/3leapsdave)

## Summary

Enhanced git hooks configuration to include dates validation category, enabling automatic detection of future dates and monotonic ordering violations in CHANGELOG.md and documentation files during git operations. This change was implemented programmatically using goneat's CLI tools without manual file editing.

## What Changed

### Hooks Configuration Updates

Updated both pre-commit and pre-push hooks to include the `dates` category:

**Pre-commit hook categories**: `format,lint` → `format,lint,dates`
**Pre-push hook categories**: `format,lint,security` → `format,lint,security,dates`

### CLI Commands Executed

All changes were made using goneat's hooks policy commands:

```bash
# Add dates to pre-commit hook (dry-run first)
goneat hooks policy set --hook pre-commit --categories format,lint,dates --dry-run

# Apply the change
goneat hooks policy set --hook pre-commit --categories format,lint,dates --yes

# Add dates to pre-push hook
goneat hooks policy set --hook pre-push --categories format,lint,security,dates --yes

# Install updated hooks
goneat hooks install
```

### Dates Configuration Verification

The existing dates configuration in `.goneat/dates.yaml` was reviewed and confirmed optimal:

```yaml
enabled: true

files:
  include:
    - "CHANGELOG.md"
    - "docs/releases/**"
  exclude:
    - "**/node_modules/**"
    - "**/.git/**"

date_patterns:
  - regex: "(\\d{4})-(\\d{2})-(\\d{2})"
    order: "YMD"

rules:
  future_dates:
    enabled: true
    max_skew: "24h"
    severity: "error"
  stale_entries:
    enabled: true
    warn_days: 180
    severity: "warning"
  monotonic_order:
    enabled: true
    files:
      - "CHANGELOG.md"
      - "docs/releases/**"
    severity: "warning"
```

## Issues This Addresses

### CHANGELOG.md Date Issues Detected

The dates validation now catches the following issues in CHANGELOG.md:

1. **Future Date Error**: `## [v0.2.2-rc.4] - 2026-01-25`
   - Severity: `error`
   - Prevents committing future-dated entries

2. **Monotonic Ordering Violation**: Release headings not in descending date order
   - Severity: `warning`
   - Sample date sequence: `2025-09-09, 2025-09-09, 2026-01-25, 2025-09-09, 2025-09-09`
   - Catches out-of-sequence version entries

3. **Informational Scan**: Comprehensive date validation across 16 changelog headings

### Hook Validation Results

Post-change validation confirms all systems working:

```bash
# Pre-commit hook now includes dates
goneat assess --hook pre-commit
# → Categories: format, lint, dates
# → Issues found: 4 dates issues + 6 format issues

# Pre-push hook includes comprehensive validation
goneat assess --hook pre-push
# → Categories: format, lint, security, dates
```

## Implementation Approach

### Why CLI Commands Over Manual Editing

This change was implemented using goneat's CLI tools to demonstrate:

1. **Discoverability**: Features can be configured without internal knowledge
2. **Transparency**: All changes are logged and auditable
3. **Safety**: Dry-run capabilities prevent accidental misconfigurations
4. **Consistency**: Ensures hooks.yaml follows proper schema validation

### Validation Process

1. **Discovery**: Used `goneat docs show user-guide/commands/hooks` to understand available commands
2. **Preview**: Used `--dry-run` flag to preview changes before applying
3. **Application**: Used `--yes` flag for non-interactive application
4. **Installation**: Used `goneat hooks install` to deploy to `.git/hooks/`
5. **Verification**: Used `goneat hooks validate` to confirm proper installation

## Impact

### Positive Outcomes

- **Automatic Quality Gates**: Future date errors now block commits (severity: error)
- **Monotonic Validation**: Changelog ordering violations caught pre-commit (severity: warning)
- **Zero Manual Intervention**: All configuration managed via CLI tools
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Both pre-commit and pre-push hooks enhanced

### Files Affected

- **Modified**: `.goneat/hooks.yaml` (categories updated)
- **Generated**: `.goneat/hooks/pre-commit` (regenerated with dates)
- **Generated**: `.goneat/hooks/pre-push` (regenerated with dates)
- **Installed**: `.git/hooks/pre-commit` (updated with dates validation)
- **Installed**: `.git/hooks/pre-push` (updated with dates validation)

## Lessons Learned

### CLI-First Configuration Benefits

This approach validates that goneat's features are:

1. **Self-Discoverable**: `goneat docs` provides comprehensive guidance
2. **CLI-Configurable**: No YAML knowledge required for basic setup
3. **Safe to Modify**: Dry-run and validation prevent misconfigurations
4. **Auditable**: All changes logged with clear command history

### Documentation Quality Validation

The dates documentation proved excellent for new users:

- Comprehensive coverage of features and limitations
- Clear configuration examples
- Practical troubleshooting guidance
- Integration examples for CI/CD

## Follow-ups

### Immediate Actions

- **Monitor Hook Effectiveness**: Verify dates validation triggers appropriately during commits
- **User Training**: Update team documentation to reference dates validation in hooks
- **CI Integration**: Consider adding dates validation to GitHub Actions workflows

### Future Enhancements

- **DX Improvements**: Implement human-readable time formatting in JSON output (planned for v0.2.4)
- **Enhanced Feedback**: Add line number reporting for single-file assessments
- **Auto-fix Capabilities**: Extend auto-fixable issues to include dates corrections where safe

### Documentation Updates

- **Hook Examples**: Add CLI-based configuration examples to user guide
- **Troubleshooting**: Document common hook configuration scenarios
- **Best Practices**: Include dates validation in CI/CD workflow recommendations

## Transparency Notes

This change was implemented transparently using goneat's own tooling to validate:

1. **Feature Discoverability**: New developers can configure dates validation without source code access
2. **CLI Completeness**: All configuration can be managed programmatically
3. **Documentation Quality**: User guides provide sufficient information for configuration
4. **Tool Reliability**: Hooks system works reliably for automated quality gates

**This repository operation demonstrates goneat's commitment to transparent, CLI-driven configuration management while enhancing code quality through automated date validation.**
