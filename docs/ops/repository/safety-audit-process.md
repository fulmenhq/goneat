# Safety Audit Process

**Purpose**: Regular audit of AI agent activities against safety protocols to ensure compliance and continuous improvement.

## Audit Schedule

### Daily Audits

- **Agent Self-Check**: Each agent reviews their own activities at session end
- **Quick Validation**: Verify no unauthorized pushes or file operations
- **Documentation**: Log any near-misses or protocol questions

### Weekly Audits

- **Supervisor Review**: @3leapsdave reviews agent activities
- **Protocol Compliance**: Check adherence to push authorization, file operations
- **Quality Gates**: Verify pre-commit/pre-push usage
- **Attribution Standards**: Confirm proper commit formatting

### Monthly Audits

- **Comprehensive Review**: Full audit of all agent contributions
- **Protocol Effectiveness**: Assess if current protocols prevent violations
- **Process Improvements**: Identify areas for enhancement
- **Training Updates**: Update agent training based on findings

### Quarterly Audits

- **Deep Dive Analysis**: Review all safety incidents and near-misses
- **Protocol Updates**: Update AGENTS.md and safety protocols based on learnings
- **Automation Opportunities**: Identify processes that can be automated
- **Team Feedback**: Gather feedback from all stakeholders

## Audit Process

### 1. Preparation

- Review audit scope and objectives
- Gather relevant logs and documentation
- Prepare audit checklist

### 2. Evidence Collection

- Git logs: `git --no-pager log --grep="Co-Authored-By" --since="1 week ago"`
- Push history: Review push timestamps and approvals
- File operations: Check for unauthorized overwrites
- Quality gate logs: Verify pre-commit/pre-push execution

### 3. Compliance Assessment

- Push Authorization: Verify all pushes had documented approval
- File Operations: Confirm existence checks before writes
- Attribution: Check commit message formatting
- Documentation: Verify referenced docs were read

### 4. Findings Documentation

- **Compliant Activities**: Document successful protocol adherence
- **Violations**: Log any protocol breaches with severity
- **Near-Misses**: Record situations that could have been violations
- **Improvement Opportunities**: Identify process enhancements

### 5. Corrective Actions

- **Minor Issues**: Immediate correction with agent retraining
- **Major Issues**: Process review and protocol updates
- **Systemic Issues**: AGENTS.md updates and team-wide training

## Audit Timeline & Tracking

### Phase 1: Implementation (Week 1-2)

- [ ] Deploy push approval checklist
- [ ] Implement session initialization protocol
- [ ] Establish push authorization workflow
- [ ] Train agents on new processes

### Phase 2: Monitoring (Week 3-4)

- [ ] Daily self-checks by agents
- [ ] Weekly supervisor reviews
- [ ] Track compliance metrics
- [ ] Identify early issues

### Phase 3: Optimization (Month 2)

- [ ] Monthly comprehensive audit
- [ ] Process refinement based on findings
- [ ] Automation of routine checks
- [ ] Update training materials

### Phase 4: Continuous Improvement (Quarterly)

- [ ] Quarterly deep-dive audits
- [ ] Protocol updates based on learnings
- [ ] Stakeholder feedback integration
- [ ] Long-term safety metrics tracking

## Metrics & KPIs

### Compliance Metrics

- **Push Authorization Rate**: % of pushes with documented approval (Target: 100%)
- **File Operation Safety**: % of file operations following existence-check protocol (Target: 100%)
- **Quality Gate Usage**: % of commits passing pre-commit checks (Target: 95%)
- **Attribution Compliance**: % of commits following attribution standards (Target: 100%)

### Process Metrics

- **Audit Completion Rate**: % of scheduled audits completed on time (Target: 100%)
- **Issue Resolution Time**: Average time to resolve audit findings (Target: <24 hours)
- **Protocol Update Frequency**: Number of protocol improvements per quarter (Target: 2-4)
- **Agent Training Completion**: % of agents completing required training (Target: 100%)

## Audit Artifacts

### Required Documentation

- **Audit Reports**: Weekly and monthly audit summaries
- **Incident Logs**: All safety violations and near-misses
- **Process Updates**: Changes to protocols and procedures
- **Training Records**: Agent training completion and feedback

### Storage Location

- **Active Audits**: `docs/ops/repository/audits/`
- **Historical Records**: `docs/ops/repository/audits/archive/`
- **Templates**: `docs/ops/templates/`

## Escalation Procedures

### Minor Issues

- Document in audit report
- Agent self-correction with supervisor oversight
- Training reinforcement

### Major Issues

- Immediate supervisor notification
- Temporary suspension of affected privileges
- Full incident review and corrective action plan

### Systemic Issues

- Cross-team review and protocol updates
- Training program enhancement
- Process automation where appropriate

## Continuous Improvement

### Feedback Loops

- **Agent Feedback**: Regular surveys on protocol effectiveness
- **Supervisor Input**: Weekly feedback on audit process
- **User Impact**: Monitor for any development speed impacts
- **Safety Metrics**: Track violation rates and response times

### Process Refinement

- **Quarterly Reviews**: Assess audit process effectiveness
- **Protocol Updates**: Update AGENTS.md based on learnings
- **Automation**: Implement automated checks where possible
- **Training**: Update training based on common issues
