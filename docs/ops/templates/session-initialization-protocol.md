# Session Initialization Protocol

**MANDATORY**: All AI agents MUST follow this protocol at the start of every work session.

## Protocol Steps

### 1. Role Confirmation

- [ ] Confirm assigned role (devlead, secrev, releng, qa, cicd, infoarch)
- [ ] Verify supervision assignment (check MAINTAINERS.md)
- [ ] Check current session context for any active work
- [ ] Review `AGENTS.local.md` if present (gitignored, tactical guidance)

### 2. Documentation Review

- [ ] Read [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md) - Operating model and guidelines
- [ ] Read [MAINTAINERS.md](../../../MAINTAINERS.md) - Supervision and governance
- [ ] Read [docs/crucible-go/standards/agentic-attribution.md](../../crucible-go/standards/agentic-attribution.md) - Attribution standards
- [ ] Read [docs/crucible-go/sop/repository-operations-sop.md](../../crucible-go/sop/repository-operations-sop.md) - Repository operations

### 3. Context Assessment

- [ ] Review recent commits: `git --no-pager log --oneline -5`
- [ ] Check repository state: `git status`
- [ ] Review active work in `.plans/active/` if applicable
- [ ] Identify any ongoing work or blockers

### 4. Safety Acknowledgment

- [ ] Acknowledge push authorization requirements (never push without approval)
- [ ] Confirm understanding of quality gate requirements (`make prepush`)
- [ ] Verify commit attribution format (role-based, per AGENTS.md)

### 5. Work Authorization

- [ ] Request explicit work scope approval from supervisor
- [ ] Document approved tasks and boundaries
- [ ] Confirm operating mode (supervised or autonomous)

## Session Documentation

```
Session Start: [Date/Time]
Role: [devlead/secrev/releng/qa/cicd/infoarch]
Model: [e.g., Claude Opus 4.5]
Interface: [e.g., Claude Code]
Supervisor: [@maintainer]
Mode: [Supervised/Autonomous]
Approved Scope: [Brief description of authorized work]
```

## Available Roles

| Role      | Scope                                           |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `devlead` | Architecture, implementation, code review       |
| `secrev`  | Security analysis, vulnerability review         |
| `releng`  | Versioning, releases, changelogs                |
| `qa`      | Testing, validation, quality gates              |
| `cicd`    | Pipelines, deployments, automation              |
| `infoarch`| Documentation, structure, standards             |

See [3leaps Role Catalog](https://crucible.3leaps.dev/catalog/roles) for baseline role definitions.

## Operating Modes

### Supervised Mode (Default)

Human maintainer reviews all work before commit. The human is accountable (Committer-of-Record).

```
Generated by <Model> via <Interface> under supervision of @<maintainer>

Co-Authored-By: <Model> <noreply@anthropic.com>
Role: <role>
Committer-of-Record: @<maintainer>
```

### Autonomous Mode (Future)

Agent operates independently within defined boundaries. Organization assumes accountability via escalation contact.

```
Generated by <Model> via <Interface> (autonomous)

Co-Authored-By: <Model> <noreply@anthropic.com>
Role: <role>
Autonomous-Agent: @<org>-agent-<role>
Escalation-Contact: @<maintainer>
```

See [agent-identity standard](https://crucible.3leaps.dev/repository/agent-identity) for autonomous operation requirements.
