# Operations Documentation

This directory contains documentation for non-standard repository operations, maintenance procedures, and significant infrastructure changes that affect the goneat project.

## Purpose

Operations documentation provides transparency and accountability for:

- Repository maintenance procedures
- Infrastructure changes and migrations
- Security and compliance operations
- Legal and licensing modifications
- Dependency and vendor transitions
- Configuration and data operations

## File Naming Convention

Operations are documented using a standardized naming format that ensures chronological sorting and easy identification:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-operation-type-brief-description.md
```

**Examples:**

- `2025-08-29-repository-version-history-rewrite.md`
- `2025-09-15-security-gpg-key-rotation.md`
- `2025-10-01-infrastructure-ci-migration-github-actions.md`
- `2025-11-12-dependencies-nodejs-18-upgrade.md`
- `2025-12-03-compliance-license-audit-apache2.md`

## Operation Categories

### 🔄 Repository Operations (`repository/`)

- Version control history modifications
- Branch strategy changes
- Repository restructuring
- Submodule operations
- Archive and backup procedures

### 🔒 Security Operations (`security/`)

- Key rotations (GPG, API tokens, certificates)
- Vulnerability response procedures
- Access control modifications
- Security audit implementations

### ⚖️ Compliance Operations (`compliance/`)

- License migrations and updates
- Legal requirement implementations
- Corporate structure changes
- Export control modifications

### 🏗️ Infrastructure Operations (`infrastructure/`)

- CI/CD system migrations
- Build system changes
- Hosting and deployment transitions
- Platform support modifications

### 📦 Dependency Operations (`dependencies/`)

- Major dependency migrations
- Vendor service transitions
- End-of-life response procedures
- Supply chain security operations

## Operation Documentation Standards

Each operation document should include:

### Required Sections

1. **Operation Summary** - Brief description and rationale
2. **Pre-Operation State** - System state before changes
3. **Operation Steps** - Detailed procedure executed
4. **Post-Operation Verification** - Validation and testing performed
5. **Impact Assessment** - Effects on users, systems, processes

### Recommended Sections

- **Risk Assessment** - Identified risks and mitigations
- **Rollback Procedure** - Steps to reverse if needed
- **Stakeholder Communication** - Who was informed and when
- **Lessons Learned** - Process improvements identified
- **Related Operations** - Links to dependent or follow-up operations

## Operation Lifecycle

1. **Planning** - Create operation document from template
2. **Review** - Technical review by maintainers
3. **Execution** - Perform operation following documented steps
4. **Verification** - Validate successful completion
5. **Documentation** - Update operation record with results
6. **Communication** - Notify stakeholders of completion

## Templates

Use standardized templates from `templates/` directory:

- `repository-operation.md` - For Git and VCS operations
- `security-operation.md` - For security-related changes
- `infrastructure-operation.md` - For CI/CD and hosting changes
- `dependency-migration.md` - For package and vendor transitions
- `compliance-operation.md` - For legal and licensing operations

## Best Practices

### Documentation

- **Be specific**: Include exact commands, versions, timestamps
- **Be transparent**: Document rationale, risks, and trade-offs
- **Be thorough**: Include pre/post state verification
- **Be timely**: Document immediately after execution

### Execution

- **Test first**: Use staging environments when possible
- **Backup always**: Create recovery points before major changes
- **Verify immediately**: Confirm successful completion
- **Communicate clearly**: Keep stakeholders informed

### Review

- **Peer review**: Have operations reviewed before execution
- **Post-operation review**: Evaluate process effectiveness
- **Template updates**: Improve templates based on experience
- **Knowledge sharing**: Share lessons learned with team

## Governance

### Approval Authority

- **Repository Operations**: Lead maintainer approval required
- **Security Operations**: Security team + lead maintainer approval
- **Infrastructure Operations**: DevOps team + lead maintainer approval
- **Compliance Operations**: Legal review + lead maintainer approval

### Retention Policy

- Keep all operation documentation permanently
- Archive completed operations after 2 years to `archived/`
- Maintain index of archived operations for reference
