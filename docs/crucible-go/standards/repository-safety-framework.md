# Fulmen Repository Safety Framework

**Framework**: Universal safety requirements and behavioral patterns that **every** repository in the Fulmen ecosystem must implement through its local `REPOSITORY-SAFETY-PROTOCOLS.md`.

> This document mirrors the policy authored in Fulmen Codex so engineering teams can reference the canonical requirements directly from Crucible. Domain-specific templates and the more thorough policy narrative still live in Codex; this copy is the standards-view for quick access.

## üéØ Purpose

Establish consistent safety foundations across all Fulmen repositories while allowing domain-specific customization via structured templates and local implementation.

## üèóÔ∏è Three-Tier Safety Architecture

### Tier 1 ‚Äì Universal Foundation (This document)

- Mandatory patterns every repository must implement.
- Non-negotiable safety behaviors and quality standards.
- Universal emergency procedures and escalation protocols.

### Tier 2 ‚Äì Domain Templates (see Fulmen Codex)

- Pre-built safety templates for common system types (CLI, services, proxies, etc.).
- Domain-specific risk patterns and mitigation strategies.
- Customizable frameworks for consistent implementation.

### Tier 3 ‚Äì Repository Implementation

- Repository-specific `REPOSITORY-SAFETY-PROTOCOLS.md`.
- Must reference (and comply with) Tier 1 and the applicable Tier 2 template.
- Adds local customization for unique risks and emergency procedures.

## üìã Mandatory Universal Requirements

### Requirement 1 ‚Äì Risk Classification System

All repositories **must** implement a three-level risk classification:

```markdown
## OPERATIONAL DANGER CLASSIFICATION

### Level 1: CATASTROPHIC ‚Äì never execute without user confirmation

- [List repository-specific catastrophic operations]

### Level 2: HIGH RISK ‚Äì validate before execution

- [List high-risk operations with validation requirements]

### Level 3: MEDIUM RISK ‚Äì proceed with caution

- [List routine operations with minor risk]
```

Each level must document specific operations, behavioral requirements, and escalation guidance (Level 1 incidents require immediate maintainer involvement).

### Requirement 2 ‚Äì Explicit Authorization Protocol

All repositories **must** document and enforce the following flow for Level 1 and Level 2 operations:

```markdown
1. STOP ‚Äì pause and assess the operation completely
2. DESCRIBE ‚Äì explain exactly what will be performed and why
3. CLASSIFY ‚Äì identify risk level and potential impacts
4. ASK ‚Äì request explicit user confirmation with full context
5. WAIT ‚Äì do not proceed until explicit authorization is received
6. CONFIRM ‚Äì repeat back what was authorized before execution
7. EXECUTE ‚Äì perform only the specific authorized operation
8. AUDIT ‚Äì document authorization and results
```

Prohibited behaviors (universal):

- Automatic execution of Level 1 operations.
- Chaining high-risk operations with `&&`, `;`, or bulk scripts.
- Proceeding without explicit authorization.

### Requirement 3 ‚Äì Quality Gate Standards

All repositories **must** maintain effective quality validation:

- Formatting and linting for all supported languages/content.
- Tests (unit/integration) meeting minimum coverage targets (default 80%).
- Security scanning (static analysis, dependency audit).
- Build/compilation success.
- Documentation consistency checks.

Quality gates may only be bypassed with explicit maintainer approval and incident tracking.

#### Commit Operation Standards

**Pre-Commit Requirements:**

- **Option A (Clean Commit):** Repository working tree is clean with no unstaged files. All changes staged and quality gates passed.
- **Option B (Partial Commit):** Explicit approval obtained to commit with unstaged files present. Approval must document reason and scope of partial commit.
- **Prohibited:** Committing without running quality gates (`make check-all` or equivalent) unless emergency bypass approval granted.

**Post-Commit Verification:**

- Always run `git status` after commit attempt to verify expected state.
- Check commit operation return code; failure requires analysis and remediation before proceeding.
- Verify commit message attribution and formatting meet standards.

#### Push Operation Standards

**Pre-Push Requirements:**

- Repository working tree **must** be clean (no unstaged files) unless emergency bypass approval obtained.
- Run `make prepush` or `make check-all` target to validate all quality gates pass.
- Verify commit history includes proper attribution for all commits in push range.
- **Prohibited:** Pushing with unstaged changes or failed quality gates without explicit emergency approval.

**Post-Push Verification:**

- Check push operation return code and output for errors or warnings.
- Verify remote branch state matches expected commits with `git log origin/branch`.
- Run `git status` to confirm clean state post-push.

### Requirement 4 ‚Äì Attribution Standards

Repositories must enforce the [Agentic Attribution Standard](agentic-attribution.md):

```markdown
Generated by [Agent Name] ([Interface](interface-url)) under supervision of [@maintainer](https://github.com/maintainer)

Co-Authored-By: [Agent Name] <noreply@fulmenhq.dev>
Co-Authored-By: [Human Name] <email@domain.ext>
```

Ensure interface prompt files (e.g., `CLAUDE.md`, `CODEX.md`, `.cline/rules/PROJECT.md`) point back to `AGENTS.md` so agent workflows remain traceable.

## üö® Emergency Preparedness (Universal Expectations)

Every repository must define:

- Emergency contact and escalation procedures.
- Incident response steps and rollback plans for Level 1 operations.
- Backup/restore or recovery paths where applicable.
- Communication plan for user/customer impact.

See Fulmen Codex ‚ÄúEmergency Procedures‚Äù for reference templates.

## üì¶ Repository Deliverables

Each repository must maintain:

1. **`REPOSITORY-SAFETY-PROTOCOLS.md`** ‚Äì references this framework, implements relevant domain template, documents repository-specific risks, and is kept current.
2. **Quality infrastructure** ‚Äì CI/CD enforcing quality gates, pre-commit hooks, coverage/reporting, and security scans.
3. **Emergency readiness** ‚Äì contact information, response steps, and tested recovery procedures.

## ‚úÖ Compliance & Audit

Suggested cadence:

- Monthly ‚Äì safety protocol compliance check.
- Quarterly ‚Äì review quality gate effectiveness.
- Annually ‚Äì full safety framework audit and update.

Compliance metrics:

- ‚â•95% commits pass quality gates on first attempt.
- Zero Level 1 operations executed without written authorization.
- 100% attribution compliance.
- Mean time to resolve safety incidents < 4 hours.

## üîß Implementation Checklist (Maintainers)

- [ ] `REPOSITORY-SAFETY-PROTOCOLS.md` references this framework and applicable template.
- [ ] Risk classification table populated with repository-specific operations.
- [ ] Authorization protocol documented and enforced.
- [ ] Quality gates configured and passing.
- [ ] Attribution standard integrated (commit templates/pre-commit).
- [ ] Emergency procedures documented with contacts.
- [ ] Agent interface files created and linked to `AGENTS.md`.
- [ ] Team training/acknowledgment recorded.

Auditors should validate the same checklist plus confirm quality gates/emergency drills are actually exercised.
