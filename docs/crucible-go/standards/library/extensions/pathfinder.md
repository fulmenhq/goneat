# Pathfinder Extension

## Scope

Deliver ergonomic helpers for scanning filesystem trees, applying inclusion/exclusion globs, and producing
metadata used by Fulmen tools (e.g., goneat). Pathfinding remains optional but widely useful for CLI tools.

## Capabilities

- Recursive scanning with inclusive/exclusive glob patterns.
- Ability to honor `.fulmenignore`-style files.
- Metadata collection: file size, checksums, modification time.
- Hooks for pluggable processors (e.g., apply validation per file).

## Implementation Notes

- **Go**: Build atop `filepath.WalkDir` with concurrency controls and context cancellation.
- **Python**: Use `pathlib.Path.rglob` / `os.scandir`. Provide async variant when running under asyncio.
- **TypeScript**: Use `fast-glob` or `@nodelib/fs.walk` for efficient traversal.

## Testing

- Fixture-based tests with nested directories verifying glob matching.
- Performance benchmarks to guard against regressions.
- Windows path handling tests (drive letters, UNC paths).

## Status

- Optional; recommended for CLI-heavy foundations. Document adoption in module manifest overrides.
