# Fulmen Security Standards (Draft)

This document is a placeholder for the upcoming Fulmen security standard. Planned scope includes:

- Authentication strategies (JWT/OIDC for HTTP, metadata tokens for gRPC)
- Authorization patterns (role-based scopes, least privilege)
- Transport security (TLS termination, mutual TLS for internal gRPC)
- Secrets management (environment variables vs. secret stores)
- Secure logging and redaction requirements

Schema Cartographer will populate this document during the next iteration.
