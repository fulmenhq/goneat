# Agentic Attribution Standard

**Status**: v2.0 - Aligned with 3leaps Crucible
**Canonical Source**: https://crucible.3leaps.dev/repository/commit-style

This document provides FulmenHQ-specific guidance on top of the 3leaps baseline standard.

## Overview

AI agent contributions use role-based attribution following the [3leaps commit style](https://crucible.3leaps.dev/repository/commit-style) standard. This ensures:

- **Transparency** - Clear visibility into AI agent contributions
- **Accountability** - Human supervision and responsibility chains
- **Traceability** - Role-based audit trails across repositories

## Baseline Standard

All FulmenHQ repositories follow the [3leaps agent-identity standard](https://crucible.3leaps.dev/repository/agent-identity) which defines:

- Role-based identity (not named agents)
- Operating modes (supervised vs autonomous)
- Attribution patterns
- Coordination model

## Commit Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

Generated by <Model> via <Interface> under supervision of @<maintainer>

Co-Authored-By: <Model> <noreply@anthropic.com>
Role: <role>
Committer-of-Record: @<maintainer>
```

### Required Elements

| Element               | Purpose                             | Required |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------- |
| `Generated by`        | Model, interface, supervising human | Always   |
| `Co-Authored-By`      | GitHub-recognized agent attribution | Always   |
| `Role`                | Agent role for this session         | Always   |
| `Committer-of-Record` | Human accountable for the commit    | Always   |

### Example

```
feat(assess): add language-aware lint for Python

Implements Python linting via ruff with tool-present gating.

Changes:
- Add python_ruff.go with runRuffCheck and runRuffFormat
- Integrate into lint_runner.go
- Skip gracefully when ruff not installed

## Role Definitions

Roles are defined in the [3leaps Role Catalog](https://crucible.3leaps.dev/catalog/roles):

| Role      | Scope                                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `devlead` | Architecture, implementation, review  |
| `secrev`  | Security analysis, vulnerability review |
| `releng`  | Versioning, releases, changelogs      |
| `qa`      | Testing, validation, quality gates    |
| `cicd`    | Pipelines, deployments, automation    |
| `infoarch`| Documentation, structure, standards   |

Repository-specific role extensions are documented in each repo's `AGENTS.md`.

## Migration from Named Agents

FulmenHQ previously used named agent identities (e.g., "Forge Neat", "Code Scout"). The v2 standard uses roles instead:

| v1 (Deprecated)                                    | v2 (Current)                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `Co-Authored-By: Forge Neat <noreply@3leaps.net>`  | `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>` |
| Identity: "Forge Neat"                             | Role: `devlead`                                    |
| Handle: @forge-neat                                | No persistent handle                               |

### Why the Change

1. **Scale**: 40+ repositories made per-repo named identities unmanageable
2. **Perception**: Named agents were misinterpreted as anthropomorphization
3. **Compatibility**: Some AI models struggle with assuming distinct named identities
4. **Simplicity**: Roles provide scope boundaries without implying persistent personality

## FulmenHQ Extensions

FulmenHQ repositories may extend the baseline with:

- **Quality indicators** (`📊 Coverage:`, `🛡️ Security:`) when applicable
- **Changes section** with bullet-pointed details
- Repository-specific role customizations in `AGENTS.md`
