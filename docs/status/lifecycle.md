# Lifecycle Status: ALPHA

This project is currently in the ALPHA phase of the Fulmen Ecosystem Lifecycle Maturity Model. ALPHA indicates active development with rapid iteration, potential breaking changes, and evolving documentation. It is suitable for internal dogfooding and early adopters who can tolerate change.

## What ALPHA means

- Stability: APIs and CLI flags may change without deprecation windows
- Quality: Known defects may exist; performance tuning is ongoing
- Coverage: Minimum test coverage gate enforced at 30% (lifecycle-driven)
- Security: Scanners run with fail-on high by default in CI/release
- Support: Best-effort; response times may vary
- Compatibility: Backward compatibility is not guaranteed between minor versions

## Operational gates (lifecycle-driven)

- Coverage gate: 30% minimum (Make target `coverage-check` enforces this via `LIFECYCLE_PHASE`)
- Release prep: Must pass `make coverage-check`, security scans, and basic assessments
- Hooks/CI: Pre-push should run format, lint, and security; release prep must also pass coverage

Lifecycle-to-gate mapping (planned):

- experimental: 0%
- alpha: 30%
- beta: 60%
- rc: 70%
- ga: 75%
- lts: 80%

To change lifecycle phase, edit the root file `LIFECYCLE_PHASE` to one of: `experimental`, `alpha`, `beta`, `rc`, `ga`, `lts`, commit, and rerun builds.

See also:
- Standards: docs/standards/lifecycle-release-phase-standard.md (allowed values and CI semantics)
- Schemas: schemas/config/lifecycle-phase-v1.0.0.json, schemas/config/release-phase-v1.0.0.json
- Ops: docs/ops/repository/2025-09-06-release-lifecycle-governance.md

## Contribution posture (ALPHA)

- External PRs: Paused except by invitation. Please file issues and feature requests.
- Issues: Bug reports and feedback welcome; please include version, OS, and reproduction steps.
- Security: Report vulnerabilities privately via maintainer contact; avoid public disclosure until coordinated.
- Road to BETA: We plan to open public PRs at BETA, once APIs stabilize and coverage gates increase.

## Guidance for users

- Intended use: Dogfooding within Fulmen and early adopters; pin versions explicitly.
- Expectations: Frequent updates; read release notes; expect breaking changes before BETA.
- Getting help: Use GitHub issues; for enterprise inquiries, contact maintainers.
