# Goneat v0.1.5 — Diff‑Aware Assessment & Suppression Insights

Release date: 2025-09-05

## Overview

This release focuses on intelligent context for large repositories and richer security governance. Assessments are now diff‑aware and security suppressions surface actionable summaries.

## New

- Diff‑Aware Assessment
  - `metadata.change_context` includes modified files, total changes, scope (small/medium/large), branch and SHA
  - Issues are annotated with `change_related` and best‑effort `lines_modified`
  - Go‑git–first implementation with CLI fallback for unified diff parsing

- Suppression Insights (Security)
  - `suppression_report.summary` now includes `by_rule_files`, `by_file`, `top_rules`, `top_files`
  - New flag: `--track-suppressions` to include suppression report in JSON output

- Status Normalization
  - Category result statuses standardized to `success`, `error`, or `skipped`

## Preview

- Smart Semantic Validation (schema‑aware): initial category scaffolding and config‑first patterns planned for 0.1.5; details to be finalized depending on scope

## Why it matters

- Reduce noise in monorepos by focusing only on the change set
- Accelerate reviews and CI gates with precise context on changed lines
- Improve governance with rollups of suppression hotspots by rule and by file

## Upgrade notes

- Mode validation: `--mode` must be `check|fix|no-op`; invalid values now error
- No breaking schema changes; new fields are additive

## Examples

```bash
# Change‑aware JSON output
goneat assess --format json --output assessment.json

# Suppression insights
goneat assess --categories security --track-suppressions --format json
```
