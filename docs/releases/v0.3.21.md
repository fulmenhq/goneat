# Goneat v0.3.21 — Dependencies Reliability + Tool Cooling Metadata

**Release Date**: 2025-12-15
**Status**: Draft

## Overview

Goneat v0.3.21 improves reliability of dependency analysis on Go 1.25 and expands tool cooling policy coverage for common installation methods.

## ✅ What changed

### Dependencies: Go 1.25 stdlib module-info failures fixed

- Dependency discovery for cooling/policy evaluation now uses `go list -deps -json` and skips stdlib packages.
- go-licenses is invoked only when `--licenses` is requested.
- License extraction degrades gracefully by scanning module directories for license files when needed.

### Doctor tools: cooling metadata for more install types

- GitHub repo inference for `kind: go` tools via `install_package` (e.g. actionlint)
- PyPI metadata for tools installed via uv/pip (e.g. yamllint)

### Lint: shfmt style args override

- `lint.shell.shfmt.args` allows repos to pass shfmt style flags (for example `["-i", "4", "-ci"]`) so lint does not enforce `shfmt` defaults.
- goneat still controls `-d`/`-w` (check vs fix mode).

### Lint: Makefile checkmake backlog cleared

- Repo config sets `lint.make.checkmake.config.max_body_length: 15`
- Large Makefile targets are split into helper targets to stay within limit
