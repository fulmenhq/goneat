# Goneat v0.3.1 â€” Build System Fix

**Release Date**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: Release

## TL;DR

- **Build System Fix**: Resolved chicken-and-egg dependency preventing fresh checkouts from building
- **Fast Follow**: Critical bug fix for v0.3.0 embed-assets workflow

## What's Fixed

### Build System Chicken-and-Egg Dependency

**Problem**: v0.3.0 introduced a circular dependency that prevented fresh repository checkouts from building:

1. `make build` requires `embed-assets` target to run first
2. `embed-assets.sh` script was trying to use `dist/goneat` binary
3. But `dist/goneat` doesn't exist until after build completes
4. Result: Fresh checkouts couldn't complete `make build` without manual intervention

**Solution**: Changed embed and verify scripts to use `go run .` instead of requiring the prebuilt binary:

- `scripts/embed-assets.sh`: Now uses `go run . content embed` instead of `dist/goneat content embed`
- `scripts/verify-embeds.sh`: Now uses `go run . content verify` instead of `dist/goneat content verify`
- Added explanatory notes in Makefile documenting the approach

**Impact**: Fresh checkouts can now run `make build` successfully without any manual steps.

## Installation

```bash
# Go install
go install github.com/fulmenhq/goneat@v0.3.1

# From source

```
