# Goneat v0.4.0 — Language-Aware Assessment for Python & JavaScript/TypeScript

**Release Date**: 2025-12-31
**Status**: Stable

## TL;DR

- **Python support**: lint and format via [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/)
- **JavaScript/TypeScript support**: lint and format via [biome](https://biomejs.dev/)
- **Tool-present gating**: gracefully skip tools that aren't installed
- **Role-based agentic attribution**: simplified AI collaboration model

## What Changed

### Language-Aware Assessment

Goneat now provides **polyglot assessment** with automatic tool detection. When supported tools are installed, goneat seamlessly integrates them:

| Language               | Lint | Format | Tool   | Install              |
| ---------------------- | ---- | ------ | ------ | -------------------- |
| **Python**             | ✅   | ✅     | ruff   | `brew install ruff`  |
| **JavaScript/TypeScript** | ✅   | ✅     | biome  | `brew install biome` |

#### Tool-Present Gating

Goneat gracefully skips tools that aren't installed—no errors, just informational logs:

```bash
# Check tool availability
goneat doctor tools --scope foundation

# Run language-aware assessment
goneat assess --categories lint,format
```

#### Usage

```bash
# Lint Python files (requires ruff)
goneat assess --categories lint /path/to/python/project

# Format JS/TS files (requires biome)
goneat assess --categories format --mode fix /path/to/js/project

# Full polyglot assessment
goneat assess --categories lint,format
```

See [assess command reference](../user-guide/commands/assess.md) for detailed options.

### Agentic Attribution v2

Migrated from named agent identities to role-based attribution following [3leaps crucible](https://crucible.3leaps.dev/) standards:

- **Before**: Named agents (Forge Neat, Code Scout, Arch Eagle)
- **After**: Role-based (devlead, secrev, releng, qa, cicd, infoarch)

New commit attribution format:

### Bug Fixes

- **Dates tests**: Fixed temporal stability by using far-future test dates (2099)

## Upgrade Notes

### Installing Language Tools

Python and JS/TS assessment requires external tools:

```bash
# Python (ruff)
brew install ruff

# JavaScript/TypeScript (biome)
brew install biome

# Verify installation
goneat doctor tools --scope foundation
```

### Breaking Changes

None. Language-aware assessment is additive and backward compatible.

## What's Next

- Rust support (planned)
- C# support (planned)
- Autonomous agent mode (future)
