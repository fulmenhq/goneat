# Goneat v0.5.5 — Gosec Output Parsing Robustness

**Release Date**: 2026-02-26
**Status**: Stable

## TL;DR

- **Less noisy gosec ingestion**: goneat now prefers gosec JSON from stdout and falls back to stderr only when needed
- **Fewer false negatives**: noisy brace-delimited fragments like `{0 packages, 0 issues}` are ignored when extracting JSON
- **Better diagnostics**: on repeated parse failure, goneat writes raw gosec stdout/stderr to a temp file and logs the path

## What Changed

### gosec stdout/stderr separation

Some gosec versions emit non-JSON warnings or progress text on stderr. goneat now captures stdout and stderr separately and parses JSON from stdout first to avoid mixing channels.

### Smarter JSON extraction

goneat previously used a greedy `{...}` extraction which could accidentally select brace-delimited, non-JSON fragments (commonly starting with `0`). The extractor now scans for the first *valid* JSON object.

### Parse-failure debug artifact

If parsing still fails after retries, goneat persists the raw stdout/stderr to a temp file (best-effort) so we can inspect the exact gosec output that triggered the failure.

## Upgrade Notes

Drop-in replacement for v0.5.4. No config migration required.
