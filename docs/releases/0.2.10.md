## What's New

### Pathfinder Schema Discovery (`goneat pathfinder`)

- **Expanded Schema Detection Engine**: Intelligent pattern matching for 10+ schema formats with enhanced discovery capabilities
- **FinderFacade API**: High-level entry point for enterprise-grade path discovery workflows with simplified interface
- **Schema Validation**: Comprehensive validation with meta-schema compliance checking and structured error reporting
- **Local Loader**: Production-ready filesystem loader with streaming text output and transform support

### Format Command Enhancements (`goneat format`)

- **JSON Prettification**: Built-in JSON formatting using Go's `json.Indent` with configurable options
  - New flags: `--json-indent` (custom string), `--json-indent-count` (1-10 spaces, 0 to skip), `--json-size-warning` (MB threshold)
  - Replaces external `jq` dependency for reliable, cross-platform JSON formatting
  - Supports compact mode and size-based warnings for large files

- **XML Prettification**: Built-in XML formatting using `etree` library with configurable options
  - New flags: `--xml-indent` (custom string), `--xml-indent-count` (1-10 spaces, 0 to skip), `--xml-size-warning` (MB threshold)
  - Validates XML well-formedness before formatting
  - Supports size-based warnings for large files

### Content Management (`goneat content`)

- **Enhanced Embedding System**: Support for embedding schemas, templates, and configuration files beyond just documentation
- **Asset Synchronization**: Better SSOT (Single Source of Truth) management for all embedded assets
- **Build Optimization**: Streamlined asset embedding process with verification and sync steps

### Git Hooks (`goneat hooks`)

- **Pre-reset Hook Support**: New `pre-reset` hook with guardian protection for reset operations
- **Guardian Integration**: Enhanced hook templates with automated guardian policy installation
- **Template Corrections**: Fixed trailing newline issues in embedded hook templates

### ASCII Terminal Calibration (`goneat ascii` command & `pkg/ascii` library)

- **Terminal Catalog System**: Comprehensive ASCII art calibration for accurate boxes across multiple terminal types
- **Display Functions**: Enhanced terminal display capabilities with proper box drawing characters
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Terminal-aware rendering for consistent visual output
- **ASCII Command**: New `goneat ascii` command for terminal calibration and display testing

### Quality & Testing Infrastructure

- **50% Test Coverage Achievement**: Comprehensive expansion across core packages:
  - `pkg/format/finalizer`: 72.5% coverage (+25.3 points) with normalization utilities testing
  - `pkg/ascii`: 31.9% coverage (+5.1 points) with terminal catalog and display function tests
  - `cmd` package: 40.7% coverage restoration with guardian compatibility

- **Automated Testing Infrastructure**:
  - `GONEAT_GUARDIAN_AUTO_DENY` environment variable for CI/CD testing workflows
  - Enhanced test fixtures and helper utilities for comprehensive validation
  - Guardian approval testing with automated denial mechanisms

### Code Quality Enhancements

- **Linting Compliance**: Resolved golangci-lint ST1015 switch statement ordering issues
- **Security Fixes**: Suppressed false positive G304 warnings in controlled file access patterns
- **Build System**: Enhanced Makefile with testing environment variables and validation targets

## Technical Details

### Test Coverage Expansion

The v0.2.10 release focused on achieving the 50% test coverage target through systematic improvements:

```bash
# Coverage breakdown by package
pkg/format/finalizer: 72.5% (+25.3 points)
pkg/ascii:           31.9% (+5.1 points)
cmd:                 40.7% (restored)
```

### Guardian Testing Infrastructure

New environment variable for automated testing:

```bash
export GONEAT_GUARDIAN_AUTO_DENY=true
make test  # Runs with guardian auto-deny for CI/CD compatibility
```

### Quality Gates

All pre-release quality checks passed:

- ✅ Code formatting and linting
- ✅ Security assessment (0 issues)
- ✅ Test coverage (50% threshold)
- ✅ Build verification across platforms
- ✅ License compliance audit

## Migration Guide
