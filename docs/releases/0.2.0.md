# Goneat v0.2.0 — Schema Validation, Scoped Discovery, and Ignore Overrides

## Highlights

- Schema validation (JSON/YAML) with offline‑first structural checks (Draft‑07, 2020‑12)
- Discovery controls: `--scope`, `--force-include`, `--no-ignore`
- Opt‑in meta‑schema validation: `--enable-meta` / `--schema-enable-meta`
- DX improvements and quoted glob guidance

## Performance

- Bad fixtures (2 files): ~260–280ms scoped
- Single file: ~200ms
- Repo schemas (5 files + meta): ~2–3s

## Commands

```bash
# Validate ignored fixtures only (scoped)
goneat validate --scope \
  --include tests/fixtures/schemas/bad/ \
  --force-include 'tests/fixtures/schemas/bad/**' \
  --format concise

# Validate repo schemas with meta validation
goneat validate --include schemas/ --enable-meta --format concise
```

Consolidated from multiple RCs; this is the stable 0.2.0 reference.
