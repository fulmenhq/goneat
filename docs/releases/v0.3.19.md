# Goneat v0.3.19 — Linux Release Artifacts (musl/glibc compatible)

**Release Date**: 2025-12-14
**Status**: Draft

## Overview

Goneat v0.3.19 makes Linux release artifacts runnable across both glibc and musl environments by building Linux binaries with `CGO_ENABLED=0`.

This prevents failures when installing goneat inside Alpine-based containers (musl) while preserving compatibility with Debian/Ubuntu runners (glibc).

## ✅ What changed

### Linux builds: CGO disabled

Linux release artifacts (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`) are now built with `CGO_ENABLED=0`.

This avoids glibc-only dynamic linkage and prevents errors such as:

- `Error relocating ...: __vfprintf_chk: symbol not found`

### Release workflow smoke test

The release workflow now runs the built linux/amd64 binary inside both:

- `alpine:3.21` (musl)
- `debian:bookworm-slim` (glibc)

This provides a concrete, automated proof that the released binary executes in both libc environments.
