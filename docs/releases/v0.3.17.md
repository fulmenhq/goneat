# Goneat v0.3.17 — Unified Ignore Scope for Lint Sidecars

**Release Date**: 2025-12-13
**Status**: Released

## Overview

Goneat v0.3.17 makes assessment scope consistent across all lint integrations. Glob-based sidecar linters now respect `.gitignore` and `.goneatignore` by default, reducing configuration duplication and aligning behavior with repository expectations.

## 🎯 Key Change: Unified Scope Contract

### What was happening

Some lint integrations (shfmt/shellcheck/actionlint/checkmake/yamllint) selected files via globbing and then relied on `.goneat/assess.yaml` `ignore:` globs to exclude directories like `node_modules/`, `vendor/`, `.git/`, etc.

This meant users sometimes had to duplicate ignore rules already present in `.gitignore` / `.goneatignore`.

### What’s new

All lint sidecars now apply repository ignore rules first:

- `.gitignore` and `.goneatignore` define eligible files
- `goneat assess --force-include <glob>` can explicitly re-include ignored paths
- `.goneat/assess.yaml` `ignore:` remains an additive, tool-specific exclusion mechanism

## 🧩 Implementation Notes

- Added repo-root-relative ignore APIs to make matching deterministic across runners.
- Added tests covering `.goneatignore` negation (`!pattern`) and `--force-include`.

## Upgrade Notes

No breaking changes. If you previously duplicated ignore globs in `.goneat/assess.yaml`, you may be able to simplify that configuration after upgrading.
