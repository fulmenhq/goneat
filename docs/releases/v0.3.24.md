# Goneat v0.3.24 — Offline Canonical ID Lookup + Spec-Host CI Guidance

**Release Date**: 2025-12-23
**Status**: Draft

## Overview

Goneat v0.3.24 hardens schema validation as a core workflow for emerging ecosystems:

- Resolve canonical URL schema IDs offline (no-network CI)
- Provide a clear two-job strategy for spec-host publishing workflows
- Sync Crucible SSOT content forward

## ✅ What changed

### Canonical `$id` lookup (offline registry mode)

When schemas use canonical `$id` URLs but the registry host is offline (or not deployed yet), goneat can resolve those IDs from a local schema tree.

- `validate suite`: manifest mappings may use `schema_id: https://...` with `source: external`
- `validate data`: `--schema https://...` can resolve from `--ref-dir`

Use `--schema-resolution id-strict` to enforce canonical-ID resolution.

### CI guidance: dual-run strategy

Canonical IDs are a contract. For spec-host workflows (e.g., building a static corpus from Crucible):

1. **Pre-deploy (required)**: offline `id-strict` against the corpus to be deployed
2. **Post-deploy (operationally critical)**: probe the live spec-host to ensure canonical URLs resolve

This avoids the chicken-and-egg problem of checking the _live_ host for a not-yet-deployed version.

### Crucible SSOT sync

- Updated embedded Crucible docs/schemas/config to `v0.2.27`.
