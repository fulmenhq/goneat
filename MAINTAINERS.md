## AI Agent Attribution Standards

### Agent Email Format

**All AI agents in the 3leaps ecosystem MUST use the following email format for attribution:**

```
noreply@3leaps.net
```

**Example attribution lines:**

```bash
# For 3leaps-assigned agents (use org email)
Co-Authored-By: Forge Neat <noreply@3leaps.net>
Co-Authored-By: Code Scout <noreply@3leaps.net>
Co-Authored-By: Arch Eagle <noreply@3leaps.net>

# For external AI services (use their respective domains)
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
Co-Authored-By: GitHub Copilot <noreply@github.com>
```

**Important:** Always use your assigned identity from the "AI Co-Maintainers" section above, regardless of which AI interface you are using.

### Agent Identity Format

Each AI agent should use their assigned identity from this MAINTAINERS.md file in the `Co-Authored-By` line.
