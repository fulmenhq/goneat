# Fulmen repository category taxonomy (machine-readable source)
version: "2025.10.2"
categories:
  - key: cli
    summary: "Command-line utilities without long-lived servers"
    primaryEntryPoints:
      - "Executable binary (Cobra/Click/etc.)"
      - "make targets"
    typicalConsumers:
      - "Developers"
      - "CI/CD pipelines"
    notes: "Outputs data to STDOUT, diagnostics to STDERR"
  - key: microtool
    summary: "Ultra-narrow, single-purpose CLI deployment/automation tool"
    primaryEntryPoints:
      - "Executable binary (single command or minimal subcommands)"
    typicalConsumers:
      - "CI/CD pipelines"
      - "Deployment automation"
      - "Internal tooling"
    constraints:
      - "MUST have single primary purpose (e.g., fixture deployment)"
      - "MUST be written in Go, TypeScript/Bun, or Rust only (no other languages)"
      - "SHOULD import helper library (gofulmen, tsfulmen, or rsfulmen)"
      - "If helper library is NOT imported, MUST NOT recreate any helper functionality (exit codes, logger, signals, config loading must be implemented independently without copying helper patterns)"
      - "MUST obey exit codes, signals, logger, config standards (whether from helper or independent implementation)"
      - "MUST NOT export packages or library interfaces (no pkg/ exports)"
      - "MUST NOT have web server endpoints"
      - "MUST NOT be imported by other repositories (one-way dependency only)"
      - "MUST remain narrow in scope (if tool grows multi-purpose, promote to cli category)"
    languages:
      - "Go (preferred for binary size and ecosystem)"
      - "TypeScript/Bun (compiled to binary)"
      - "Rust (when rsfulmen stable)"
    notes: "Microtools enforce architectural discipline through narrow scope and helper library dependency. One-way dependency flow (microtool → helper → SSOT) prevents circular dependencies. CDRL templates follow naming: forge-microtool-{instrument} where {instrument} uses hand tools/precision instruments with first letter matching language (grinder/gauge/gouge for Go, tongs/tap/trammel for TypeScript, rasp/reamer/router for Rust) - distinguishes from workhorse (horse breeds)."
    examples:
      - "fulmen-fixtures (fixture deployment and generation)"
    templateNaming:
      pattern: "forge-microtool-{instrument}"
      note: "First letter of instrument matches implementation language (Go=G, TypeScript=T, Rust=R)"
      instruments:
        - "grinder (Go - heavy processing)"
        - "gauge (Go - measurement/validation)"
        - "gouge (Go - data extraction)"
        - "tongs (TypeScript - data handling)"
        - "tap (TypeScript - threading/integration)"
        - "trammel (TypeScript - precision layout)"
        - "rasp (Rust - file processing)"
        - "reamer (Rust - data refinement)"
        - "router (Rust - path/routing tools)"

    notes: "Requires request correlation IDs and Prometheus metrics. CDRL templates follow naming: forge-workhorse-{breed} where {breed} uses horse breeds (groningen, percheron, clydesdale, shire, etc.)."
    templateNaming:
      pattern: "forge-workhorse-{breed}"
      breeds:
        - "groningen (Go implementation)"

    templateNaming:

      note: "Naming pattern for codex templates TBD - should be meaningful but distinct from workhorse (horse breeds) and microtool (instruments)"

      - "MAY use minimal SSG only when partials/reuse justified"
    notes: >
      Missive repositories favor vanilla HTML/CSS with zero build. Escalate to Codex when multi-page, search, or content collections are needed.

    notes: >
      Spec-host repositories prioritize raw artifact access over rich browsing. Canonical URL resolution is the primary invariant. A Codex site may layer browsable UI over a spec-host corpus. See Spec Publishing Standard for canonical ID requirements.

      pattern: "forge-spec-host-{name}"
      note: "Naming pattern TBD - should reflect the corpus being hosted"
