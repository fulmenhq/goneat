# Goneat v0.3.25 — Checkmake Makefile Discovery Fix

**Release Date**: 2025-12-27
**Status**: Draft

## Overview

Goneat v0.3.25 is a focused DX fix: Makefile linting via checkmake now reliably runs on root-level `Makefile` targets.

## ✅ What changed

### Lint: checkmake now discovers root `Makefile`

Previously, include patterns like `**/Makefile` could fail to match a root-level `Makefile`, causing checkmake to silently skip.

v0.3.25 fixes Makefile discovery so:

- default Makefile lint paths include both `Makefile` and `**/Makefile`
- `**/Makefile` patterns now work reliably for root-level Makefiles

### Release tooling: upload honors `GONEAT_GPG_HOMEDIR`

`make release-upload` now prefers `GONEAT_GPG_HOMEDIR` (with legacy `GPG_HOMEDIR` fallback) when verifying checksum signatures.
