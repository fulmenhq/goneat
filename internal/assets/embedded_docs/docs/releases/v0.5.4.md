# Goneat v0.5.4 — Biome Nested-Config Fixes and YAML Parse Error Clarity

**Release Date**: 2026-02-25
**Status**: Stable

## TL;DR

- **Biome monorepo fix**: `goneat format` and `goneat format --check` now execute Biome from per-file resolved config context (nearest `biome.json`/`biome.jsonc`), fixing nested root config failures
- **Assess parity fix**: `goneat assess --categories format` now applies per-context Biome grouping, preventing nested-config JSON parse failures
- **YAML check UX fix**: yamlfmt parse errors are now surfaced as syntax errors instead of misleading "needs formatting" messages

## What Changed

### Biome Context Resolution in `format`

Biome 2.4+ can fail in monorepos with nested Biome roots when invoked from the
wrong working directory. goneat now resolves invocation context per file and runs
Biome from the nearest config root with relative file arguments.

This fixes failures like:

```
Found a nested root configuration, but there's already a root configuration.
```

### Biome Context Resolution in `assess`

`assess --categories format` and Biome lint assess paths now group JS/TS files by
resolved Biome context and execute per-group. This prevents mixed-root Biome
invocations that previously produced non-JSON output and parse errors.

This aligns assess behavior with `format`/`format --check` and fixes `make fmt-check`
flows that run assess first.

### YAML Parse Error Detection in Check Mode

`yamlfmt` exits with status 1 for both formatting differences and YAML syntax
errors. goneat now inspects output to distinguish these cases:

- Invalid YAML: reported as syntax error with yamlfmt details
- Valid but unformatted YAML: reported as needs formatting

Detection now uses case-insensitive matching for robustness.

### Incremental Lint Fix-Mode Guard

Restored expected behavior for `--fix --new-issues-only` by ensuring Biome lint
fix pass executes before incremental reporting.

## Upgrade Notes

Drop-in replacement for v0.5.3. No configuration changes required.

For local dogfooding, install the latest built binary before downstream testing:

```bash
make build install
goneat version
```
