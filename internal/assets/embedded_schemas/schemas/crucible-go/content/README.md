# Content Metadata Schemas

Crucible hosts canonical schemas for tooling that bundles, syncs, and tracks content metadata. Three schemas are currently supported:

- **binary-embed-manifest** – lightweight manifest used by FulDX and other microtools for bundling static assets (e.g., README content) into binaries.
- **embed-manifest** – richer manifest used by goneat (and future tooling) supporting global filters, topic overrides, tags, and asset presets.
- **ssot-provenance** – audit trail metadata generated by SSOT sync tools (e.g., goneat) to track source repository versions, commits, and dirty states.

Consumers choose the schema appropriate to their workflow and validate manifests using FulDX or local schema tooling.
