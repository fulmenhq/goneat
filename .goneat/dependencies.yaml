# Goneat Dependency Protection Configuration
# ============================================================================
# This file configures license compliance, package cooling (supply chain
# security), and SBOM generation for your project.
#
# Quick Start:
#   1. Review and customize the forbidden licenses below
#   2. Enable cooling policy (already enabled by default)
#   3. Add exceptions for trusted packages (your organization, etc.)
#   4. Test: goneat dependencies --licenses --cooling
#   5. Add to hooks: see docs/user-guide/workflows/dependency-gating.md
#
# Documentation:
#   - Overview: docs/guides/dependency-protection-overview.md
#   - Cooling Policy: docs/guides/package-cooling-policy.md
#   - Full Reference: docs/user-guide/commands/dependencies.md

version: v1

# ============================================================================
# LICENSE COMPLIANCE POLICY
# ============================================================================
# Automatically detect and enforce license policies across dependencies.
# Works OFFLINE - uses local go.mod/package.json/etc.
#
# Commands:
#   goneat dependencies --licenses
#   goneat assess --categories dependencies
#
licenses:
  # Forbidden licenses (build fails if detected)
  forbidden:
    - GPL-3.0      # Strong copyleft - requires derivative works to be GPL
    - AGPL-3.0     # Network copyleft - triggers on network use
    - MPL-2.0      # Mozilla Public License - weak copyleft with patent concerns
    # - LGPL-3.0   # Uncomment if you want to forbid LGPL too
  
  # Explicitly allow only safe, permissive licenses (stricter approach)
  # ONLY these licenses are allowed, all others are forbidden:
  allowed:
    - MIT
    - Apache-2.0
    - BSD-3-Clause
    - BSD-2-Clause
    - ISC
    - 0BSD
    - Unlicense
  
  # Optional: License-specific exceptions
  # Use sparingly - document approval and reason:
  # exceptions:
  #   - package: "github.com/example/special-pkg"
  #     license: "GPL-3.0"
  #     reason: "Legal team approved after review"
  #     approved_by: "@legal-team"
  #     approved_date: "2025-10-28"
  #     ticket: "LEGAL-1234"

# ============================================================================
# PACKAGE COOLING POLICY (Supply Chain Security)
# ============================================================================
# Enforces a waiting period before adopting newly published packages.
# Protects against supply chain attacks (compromised maintainer accounts,
# malicious code injection, typosquatting).
#
# ⚠️  REQUIRES NETWORK ACCESS - queries package registries
#
# Best Practices:
#   - Use in pre-push hooks (not pre-commit - too slow)
#   - Use in CI/CD pipelines
#   - Start with alert_only=true, then enforce after team buy-in
#
# Commands:
#   goneat dependencies --cooling
#   goneat assess --categories dependencies
#
cooling:
  # Enable/disable cooling policy globally
  enabled: true
  
  # ---- Core Thresholds ----
  
  # Minimum package age (days since publication)
  # Recommendation: 7 days (80% of attacks detected within this window)
  # Conservative: 14 days (95% detection)
  # Ultra-secure: 30 days (for critical infrastructure)
  min_age_days: 7
  
  # Minimum total downloads (lifetime)
  # Ensures package has some adoption/vetting
  # Recommendation: 100 (reasonable baseline)
  # Permissive: 50 (allows earlier adoption)
  # Conservative: 1000 (only established packages)
  min_downloads: 100
  
  # Minimum downloads in last 30 days
  # Ensures package is actively maintained
  # Recommendation: 10 (some ongoing use)
  # Stricter: 100 (actively used packages only)
  min_downloads_recent: 10
  
  # ---- Enforcement Mode ----
  
  # alert_only: false means FAIL BUILD on violations
  # alert_only: true means WARN ONLY (good for gradual rollout)
  alert_only: false
  
  # Grace period (days) to fix violations without blocking
  # Useful during initial rollout or when addressing existing violations
  # Recommendation: 3 days (standard grace period)
  # Extended: 7 days (large teams with many dependencies)
  grace_period_days: 3
  
  # ---- Trusted Package Exceptions ----
  
  # Allow specific packages to bypass cooling period
  # ⚠️  USE SPARINGLY - each exception reduces security effectiveness
  #
  # Exception patterns use glob syntax:
  #   - github.com/myorg/*        matches all packages in your org
  #   - */cobra                   matches any package named "cobra"
  #   - github.com/spf13/*        matches all packages by spf13
  #
  exceptions:
    # Trust FulmenHQ organization's internal packages
    - pattern: "github.com/fulmenhq/*"
      reason: "Internal FulmenHQ packages are pre-vetted by maintainers"
      approved_by: "@3leapsdave"
      approved_date: "2025-10-28"
    
    # Example: Trust established maintainer
    # - pattern: "github.com/spf13/*"
    #   reason: "spf13 is trusted maintainer (cobra, viper, etc.)"
    #   approved_by: "@tech-lead"
    #   approved_date: "2025-10-28"
    
    # Example: Temporary exception with expiration
    # - module: "github.com/example/urgent-fix"
    #   until: "2025-12-31"
    #   reason: "Emergency security fix required immediately"
    #   approved_by: "@cto"
    #   ticket: "SEC-1234"
  
  # ---- Development vs Production (Optional) ----
  
  # Different policies for dev dependencies (test frameworks, build tools)
  # vs production dependencies (runtime requirements)
  #
  # Uncomment to enable:
  # production:
  #   min_age_days: 14           # Stricter for production
  #   min_downloads: 1000
  # development:
  #   min_age_days: 3            # More lenient for dev tools
  #   min_downloads: 50

# ============================================================================
# POLICY ENGINE CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================
# goneat uses embedded OPA (Open Policy Agent) for policy evaluation.
# Advanced: Can connect to remote OPA server for centralized policies.
#
policy_engine:
  # Type: "embedded" (recommended) or "server" (advanced)
  type: embedded
  
  # Remote OPA server (only if type: server)
  # remote:
  #   url: "https://opa.example.com"
  #   auth:
  #     type: "bearer"           # or "basic", "mtls"
  #     token_env: "OPA_TOKEN"   # Environment variable with token
  
  # Local Rego policy files (advanced - custom OPA policies)
  # rego_files:
  #   - ".goneat/policies/custom-licenses.rego"
  #   - ".goneat/policies/custom-cooling.rego"

# ============================================================================
# SBOM CONFIGURATION (Software Bill of Materials)
# ============================================================================
# Generate SBOMs for compliance, security auditing, and transparency.
# Works OFFLINE - uses local dependency graph.
#
# Commands:
#   goneat dependencies --sbom
#   goneat dependencies --sbom --sbom-output custom/path.json
#
# ⚠️  IMPORTANT: Add 'sbom/' to .gitignore to prevent committing SBOMs
#
# sbom:
#   # Output directory for generated SBOMs
#   # Default: sbom/ in project root
#   output_dir: sbom
#   
#   # SBOM format
#   # - cyclonedx-json: fully supported (goneat extracts counts/graph metadata)
#   # - spdx-json: generation supported; some summary metadata is CycloneDX-only today
#   format: cyclonedx-json

#   
#   # Include development dependencies in SBOM
#   # true: Include test frameworks, build tools, etc.
#   # false: Production dependencies only (recommended)
#   include_dev_dependencies: false
#   
#   # Security note:
#   # SBOM extraction is capped at 500 MB per file to prevent
#   # decompression bombs (ErrArchiveTooLarge).

# ============================================================================
# ASSESSMENT INTEGRATION
# ============================================================================
# The 'goneat assess --categories dependencies' command uses this config
# and provides unified reporting with other quality categories.
#
# Hook Integration Examples:
#
# Pre-commit (fast, offline):
#   - command: dependencies
#     args: ["--licenses", "--fail-on", "high"]
#
# Pre-push (comprehensive, online):
#   - command: dependencies
#     args: ["--licenses", "--cooling", "--fail-on", "high"]
#
# CI/CD (full validation):
#   - command: assess
#     args: ["--categories", "dependencies", "--format", "json"]
#
# For complete workflow patterns, see:
#   docs/user-guide/workflows/dependency-gating.md

# ============================================================================
# QUICK TROUBLESHOOTING
# ============================================================================
#
# Problem: "All packages fail cooling policy"
# Solution: Check network access to package registries, verify system clock
#
# Problem: "Cooling checks timeout"
# Solution: Increase timeout in hooks.yaml, configure proxy if behind firewall
#
# Problem: "Package blocked but it's actually old"
# Solution: Clear cache: rm -rf ~/.goneat/cache/registry/
#
# Problem: "Development is too slow"
# Solution: Move cooling checks to pre-push only, keep pre-commit fast
