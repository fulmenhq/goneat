# yamlfmt configuration for goneat
# This file configures yamlfmt to match goneat's YAML formatting preferences

formatter:
  type: basic
  indent: 2
  line_ending: lf
  # Note: yamlfmt doesn't support all the options goneat tracks:
  # - quote_style (single/double)
  # - trailing_newline control
  # These would need to be enforced by other means or accepted as yamlfmt defaults

# Exclude patterns
